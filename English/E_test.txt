Just a warning, the red is a real bright red not a darker maroon. It is hard to match with honestly, but three watches for such a cheap price, i couldnt pass up on the deal. I've started to really like these silicone bands because they are so nice on the wrist and you dont even notice sometimes you are wearing a watch. I ordered a different white one so i gave it to my cousin as a gift and she was thrilled because she thought i spent a lot on a watch for her LOL	0
These provide excellent for lighting outside deck stairs. During the summer months they will remain lit all night. Note, in standby mode they shine a nice dim light. When motion is detected, they go to high power as long as movement is detected, or approximately 30 seconds. During winter months, they will operate for several hours, but run out of power before dawn; this isn't an issue for me. They do need several hours of direct sunlight in order to recharge the batteries.	1
A few folks in the medical field talked me out of using this...so now I have it but am afraid to put it on the baby!  Even though the necklace is safety knotted on every bead they told me to consider what would happen if it did break and the baby swallowed the whole necklace.  My baby is never out of my sight and I had been taking it off him at bed time and nap time, but it is just not worth the risk in my opinion.	0
Those diaper bags get the work done. It holds the dirty diapers very well. I use this  as a result i highly recommed this is great product. and its price is so much low .if you don't trust me so please you purchase and use it.	1
I was looking for two ottomans to put on one side of a coffee table in my living room. Haven't picked out the rest of the furniture yet, but am hoping that these match whatever I do. They are pretty great because I feel like I could put them just about anywhere if they don't work out where planned.	1
It is, technically, a prismatic compass. However, it is not anywhere near the military issued version.	1
Cool and unique ring! My husband put it right on, he liked that he never saw a ring like this before.  It is flexible and he recommends selecting a finger that is within 1-size of the actual ring size for the best fit. The ring fits so comfortably, he forgets he is wearing it.  I purchased this ring at a reduced rate for my review and made my husband so happy.	1
Best product for a child ever. As many kids my son has far more toys than he will ever know or play with but he has nowhere to put this growing pile. I was skeptical when I first opened it but after starting my transferring I started my complete adoration transformation. Ots great and deep. Will be buying another one very soon. Sturdy enough for me (185 lbs) to sit on and it stay firm. Looks just like the picture and is true to color. On the sides are a mesh net for extra storage if needed. Love love love this bin!	0
The Beard Oil gave me a nice healthy sheen and managed my coarse hair. I would definitely recommend this!	1
The construction is okay for the price. Since it is particle board, the construction is somewhat questionable, but I think it will serve its purpose for the time being. The mattress is supported by the metal beams and I think it will hold up for this reason.	1
They work well but I don't know why sometimes they don't automatically work. I have to smack them sometimes to get the signal to come in.	0
Invaluable to my studies. I have a white board which I use to throw on important information, but it is not large enough for one exam's content, no matter how succinct I try to be. Getting an extra board was expensive and I didn't want to drill another pair of holes into my rental, so I found this stick-on chalkboard. Half of it is already almost twice as large as my whiteboard, and it only took me a couple of  minutes to throw it on the wall. I was a bit worried that it was a &#34;one shot deal&#34; with regards to putting it on perfectly, but readjusting or moving it around is no problem; no sticky residue to worry about as this seems to adhere by static.	1
A beautiful bikini set, I love bright colours so this couldn't have been better for me. The perfect size and is very comfortable to wear.	1
We bought this for my granddaughter and she says she's made several bracelets and really loves it. If you have a creative young one in your family,this is easy to recommend.	1
It lessens the damage your grill will endure over time. Its high quality, heavy vinyl cover has ensured protection for my grill since the day I bought it and that too without any complains. It fits my grill perfectly, looks sleek and is very very durable.	1
The best possible sunglasses for this price, my friend have them and he likes them since they are fine quality nice lenses they look stylish and light as feather. Planing to buy them too since the color is great material is solid plastic and they are not very usually in crowd,	1
Easy installation, I have used it for a while, Printed 4500 pages on my Brother 6180 and still going, Nothing to complain about.	1
I always like to order my water with lemon in restaurants, lime or a slice of orange. At home I also do the same thing - just squeeze a wedge of lemon or lime and drop it in the glass. Sometimes it is just so hard to try and drink the recommendation amount of daily water when you are drinking it &#34;straight up&#34;. Now with the Fruit Infused Water Bottle by Acquablend I am able to load up infuser tube with lots of fruits and just refill the bottle and enjoy flavored water all day long.  I really like that this bottle is transparent and you can see what is inside. It has a wide mouth instead of a spout. As you drink you can smell the delicious aroma of the fruits from the infused chamber. The caps also seals to a leak proof seal. 100 percent BPA-free and dishwasher safe.  Fill it with anything you want. My favorites are grapefruit, lemons, limes, strawberries, oranges, raspberries and passion fruit seeds (crushed a little bit). You can really make you imagination go wild with this bottle. Your only limits are the fruits you have in the house. Overall its a great product and I am very happy with this purchase !!	1
I bought it a week ago, the soundstage is excellent, as is the overall sound accuracy. these feel good on the head, and have been fine for several hours without discomfort or sweating.	1
Below average sound quality, the sound was crackly and unclear even when directly next to the computer it was attached by Bluetooth.  Either in Bluetooth mode or  using the audio jack, the buzzing noise is very loud. I'm very disappointed with this product. I should have save more and get a something better.	1
Definitely not what I ordered for the second time. Advertised as having a cast aluminum grate! Came with steel grate. False advertising!<br /> Not going trough the hassle of sending it back again.	0
I was hesitant to buy these socks with only 86% cotton listed, but I decided to try them anyway.<br />When I received the socks they were 83% cotton and not as described in the listing.  I wore one<br />pair of them one day and my feet have not sweat so much in I don't know how long.  Maybe I will<br />save them for next winter when the temperature is freezing.	0
Children LOVE these bands and have made a lot of really cool different bracelet patterns using them. the tye dye bands make each creation unique because they are not a uniform color.	1
I have one of this. My daughter was very pleased with the back pack and it's quality. The Zipper and clasps were metal, the leather was a solid piece, not patched work, the top handle is strong.The quality is superb!	1
Bought this for my 2004 Honda Rancher 350 that I rebuilt. It was well priced and a direct fit. No modifications needed. I didn't really notice any performance gains with this alone. I was running a clutch kit - HMF set up and snorkels. But its better thats the OEM filter.	0
In this new datadisk is lot of news. Dungeons, maps, raids, higher max. level.<br />Lot of new fun! And all is running on new engine. Really nice datadisk!<br />Lot of hours full of FUN!<br /><br />PROS<br />- 90lvl boost<br />- New Continent - Draenor (7 zones, 1 PvP zone)<br />- Max level 100<br />- Building own garrisons and upgrading them<br />- New PvP zone<br />- New monsters<br />- New items and rewards<br />- Hundreds of new Quests<br />- Changes in inventory<br /><br />CONS:<br />- you must pay monthly to be able to play.	1
I don't like that the design looks dirty and really it is not. It would be better if it were more white	0
As I went through my class to remove my CCW the instructor in our county is the Dist. Atty. One of the films we saw was of two police officers both carrying 3/57 trying to deliver a warrant was attacked. After they had used all the ammunition they had on their person which consisted of two speed loaders each 24 rounds 12 rounds in the revolvers the perpetrator was shot through the skull and literally had lost part of his gray matter. One officer got to his partners handgun who had one shot left and finally dropped the perpetrator although his partner was dead. These are comfortable nonintrusive and with my S&W 40 carries 13 rounds each ,Ease of Access, comfortable carry, easy access, can you want something more?	0
This is as I expected. The price per is the lowest I've found. I was also able to find at my local grocery store for the same price though. This formula works well for my twins who both have reflux, it mixes well and doesn't stay foamy.	1
The quality is very poor. It's sturdy and comfortable but the sound is horrible. I bought these for my girlfriend for birthday so she could edit with and I didn't want to believe her when she said the didn't sound right. As soon as I hear the first song on them I said they were going back.	1
bought jansport superbreak  backpack for my daughter,we received the bag in good condition ,the colors are amazing,my daughter always compliment it.	1
If you aren't as advanced and just want a solid wireless signal for the money, this is the one to get.	1
Huge, versatile heavy duty gate that doubles up as barrier gate for woodstove or fireplace, play-area or even a pet pen. Very functional!<br /><br />The gate is easy to set up and can be put back in a neat and easy manner.<br /><br />Great gate for parents or people with pets!	0
He really likes this item. He has one on each of his controllers, he like it because it won't slip out of his hand while in used.	0
wow what a camera , I am totally amazed with this camera, the picture quality is too good, it also have android os  and a wifi facility which helps me to share my pics on my social media . The camera is durable  and easy to handle , it also have a light weight  which can be taken anywhere when we go to outings. Highly recommend to all the people who love to click as well as share it to the world	1
If you haven't tried these yet, you are totally depriving yourself of the very best jelly bean ever. I cannot get enough of the delicious, delectable buttery taste!	0
I guess I should have read the negative reviews more carefully because this stylus results you get from this stylus are pretty poor for the high price they charge.<br /><br />The pen has several faults starting with where the power button is located. I had to constantly try and rotate the pen so I wouldn't hit the power button.  Very annoying<br /><br />Next the so called worlds best stylus couldn't even capture my signature any better than my cheap 5 dollar griffin stylus.<br /><br />I honestly feel like I was ripped off<br /><br />Ok so then I gave the stylus to my friend who is a professional graphic artist to test it and see if it was just me that was having issues.  After 10 minutes of use she told me this was not worth the money I spent and directed me to buy something different.<br /><br />I can say that this stylus does NOT take notes very well and you spend more time trying to correct the poor results than just trumping a note or using a cheapie stylus<br /><br />I've decided that my 5 dollar griffin will do better than this 70 dollar toy<br /><br />My search continues for a good active stylus<br /><br />Trust me and avoid this at all costs	1
Setup was very easy.  Has a great array of premium services available (Netflix, HuluPlus etc.)  Connected with no issue to our wireless network and play via the services was great.  Menus are easy to navigate.  Playback from blu ray discs has been outstanding.  2 issues with this unit have nothing to do with the unit itself but with delivery.  The unit was packed inadequately in the shipping box with it being free to slide around.  Given the state of the shipping box, I would say it was subject to a good deal of abuse during the shipping process which leads me to wonder if damage has been done to the unit (none observed at this time but only time will tell).  Secondly, it took from 2/16 until 2/24 for the unit to arrive in the Rochester NY area from Pennsylvania via USPS.  Overly long shipping time and apparently one of the reasons why the packages looks as beat as it did (any wonder why USPS has issues?)  Would purchase this unit again but only if it not being shipped USPS.	0
Great face mask of minerals from dead sea. Shipped with prime. It gives a burning/tingling sensation for a lil while when u apply, but the skin feels soft and fresh after. All natural cleanser and exfoliator. Came with an ebook which you can download online, havent looked at that much though.	1
This battery is used in the Arris TM822 internet and telephone modem.<br />.<br />The battery is very reliable. It has operated without fail for the past 1.5 years.	0
My son and I use these while sailing to communicate over wind noises and him being 40-45 feet away from me at times raising sails or dropping anchor.  The full duplex feature is very useful as we can communicate without stepping on each other's transmission.  We were able to carry on a dialogue while anchoring off which would have been impossible with us waving and yelling to each other.  We found we kept them on while we were both in the cockpit simply because we could hear and understand each other better.  We are looking at adding another remote; however, the lack of communication between remotes may present a problem - the &#34;remotes&#34; can only talk to the &#34;master,&#34; so the master would have to relay communications between the remotes.  Other than that, it's a really nice piece of technology.	0
I purchased this chair for my sister to use while recuperating from a total hip replacement. The firm but comfortable seat was great and the position was perfect for her hip precautions. The chair is very sturdy and stable. Now we find that it is a handy addition to our family room when we have people over. Highly recommended for extra seating in family room or office.	1
I bought this to install a TV out in my garage. It is exactly what I needed, and it works great, and you can't beat the price.	0
So pleasantly pleased with this purchase.  Lamp is heavy weight and not at all flimsy.  Looks elegant in my room.  It was packaged very snugly and arrived in perfect condition.	0
Fit perfect and is exactly what i wanted, came in quickley and will do the job. I would purchase this again	0
I bought this for my mom for her birthday. I put 3 birthstones and a heart that says Nana in it. They fit great and there is still room for more. Its great quality and does not look cheap at all.	1
I hate the Key. It is very bad product not great quality.  I purchased the product  1 wieek  ago and I am not pleased used the product. The key do not working. I would not tell anyone purchase it. I always hate the product.	1
$7 for this?  Crazy cheap for a great product. I ordered this specifically to help me see to solder up a 28 pin round connector and now I use it frequently for working on tiny stuff.  3 levels of magnification, depending on how many lenses you drop into place, the head band is easily adjustable.  My only gripe might be the side knobs don't really tighten enough.	0
I wore a t-shirt with this shirt and left it unbuttoned.  Worked like a champ.  The pants, I just tightened the belt.	0
finish cracks off easily and the edges are sharp- dont bother- probably loaded with lead also but I didnt test it	0
Love these things. I do maintenance for a living, fits perfect in my tool bag. Durable enough for a plastic container, it will eventually break but lasts long enough to pay for itself a few times over. I bought 2	0
They are good products and put out the amount of light I expected. On sale, the price was very good, which I why I leaped. But you always have to look at how long it will take you to recoup the money you spent on the bulb vs the amount of electricity you saved.	1
I love buying from here I ordered two bridal sets until I get my wedding ring resized this rings looks way better than the other one I purchased. The shipping is always fast it arrived in two days. This really looks very real you wouldn't be able to tell its cubic zirconia just by looking. I would recommend this ring to anyone. I love the shape of this ring and the carat size!	1
I was already using Mr. beams motion controlled path lights (square) and I am satisfied with them.  The controller and ceiling lights that come on during power failures in this set are a nice addition.  However, I am not a fan of ceiling lights using C-size batteries.  I use LSD rechargeable AAs in path lights and would like to see AAs in ceiling lights too.	0
It's a comfortable and stylish backpack with the perfect amount of space inside. Definitely recommend it.	0
The leather backpack is as pictured,I like it so much. I am extremely happy with this purchase and highly recommend it to others,the price is great, the leather looks expensive! Everything is in place. I got compliments a lot for this backpack.	1
I've been looking at earring cuffs for a while now and desperately wanted one because they all look so gorgeous. I didn't want a heavy, obnoxious looking one though, so I decided to go for something smaller but still noticeable. This was my Christmas present to myself, along with a few others, and it arrived a day right before Christmas so I was really happy about that. When I opened it up, I saw that it was small, a bit smaller than I had expected, but I liked it anyway. It took some adjusting but I had finally gotten the hang of it. It's so easy to adjust to your ear and I found it really comfortable. You hardly notice that it's on, once you get it on the right spot, and I wore this for my annual family Christmas dinner. I got a lot of compliments on it!	0
When I think of a video game, I imagine that it would be developmentally appropriate for my older son. It's taken some time and he can play most of it, but it's been a challenge. I wish they had something for the younger set. The price is a bit high, too.	1
This is not the worse can opener either the best. Dnt work so good for small can like tomatoes paste kind of hard. Works fine for my beans can and veg.	1
Bought this as a present for myself, and absolutely loved it and was surprised and shocked when I got such a caring and thoughtful gift in the mail!!!	0
Classic and cool. Works well as a pincushion. The green stripes are easily removed, though, so what happened to mine was that it now resembles a clown nose.	1
I've had this for almost a month and it's working out great.  It's a little smaller than my stock handle but it feels more solid because it's metal.  It mounted easily and it's snug.  For $12 you can't go wrong.	0
A top WILL break and/or one of the compartments won't stay in place.  But for the money and compactness I bought it again.​	0
They are beautiful! My wrist is 7&#34; in diameter and they are a bit snug, hence the four stars. Love them!! Would love a garnet, aquamarine, peridot, but smaller like 7mm. Highly recommend!	0
This is apparently a flimsy product as my brother snapped the bands in just 3 days of use. He got some used out of it, so my job is done.	1
I love this thing. I have an older car, and have used this several times to pinpoint and fix the inevitable problems myself, rather than sacrifice money to the auto shop gods. This will also give you some idea what the error codes actually mean, and allows you to clear them. Navigation is also really easy, which isn't always the case with some units that attempt to get by with less than half the buttons of this thing.<br /><br />I've only dipped my toes into the more advanced functions. Honestly there's more capability available than I could really competently use. But it's been nice to have available.	1
I got this at Walmart on Black Friday and it has worked great to date. The only issue I had was the remote didn't work right out of the box, but Emerson sent me a new one right away. Great PC Monitor and the 720p works great with Netflix on my Roku box too.	1
Just picked this ring up today, got it for my daughter. Everything was perfect and it arrived about two weeks earlier than expected. This ring is a great value, alot cheaper than ordering through the school and its perfect! I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a class ring.	1
Bought it for my friend as a birthday gift. She likes it a lot and put it in her car all day. Great gift option	1
Title says it all. Walked outside and women were lining up to see my man short shorts. Best investment ever	0
Set up was easy. So was adfing my Netflix and Hulu Plus accounts. Discovered that CBS All Access isn't available on any device, including Roku. Box heats up quite a bit so we unplug it when we're not watching tv. The headphone jack on the remote works and is a real plus. HD picture a nice touch too. Just hoping it keeps working, as some reviewers said it died after a short while. That may habe been the overheating.	0
FINALLY, I can open these darn screws!!! Good assortment. I don't use often, but when I do, it is the right tool for the job.	0
This kombucha starter kit is just what I needed and they really put together everything I need for a good price. I've been making this for my whole family and we drink it every morning. It has really helped with our health good purchase.	1
Fits comfortably in the car and appears comfortable for the baby.  Buckles easy to connect.  I really like the color, too.	0
Beautiful looking table. But after playing on it for a week I noticed a bubble on the felt. After taking the table apart. Seen how the felt was put on. Board then some kind of laminates then the felt. But the felt is cut to fit just the top. Not wrapped under. Disappointing.	1
Such a nice, basic watch - and at a great price!  Large face with easy-to-read numbers - no squinting!<br />I personally like the expansion wristband. I need to remove the watch frequently for hand-washing, and this just slips on and off or pushes up my arm - no clasps to fiddle with with dirty hands. The lighting feature is also very useful - just push the side mechanism and the face lights up.  No worries about losing or trashing an expensive watch. Love it.	0
I purchased these headphones on ebay used. I really like them. I'm new to djing but not new to music listening. For under $100 I'm very pleased. Replaceable cord, comfortable fitment and stylish as hell. It dont hurt that they match my NS7 perfectly. If your looking for a good sounding, great looking DJ headphones for less the $100 pick these up.	0
Worked great out of the box. Easy to set up, I got all my apps running pretty quickly. The user interface was very friendly and the air remote pretty intuitive. Got the hang of it after about 10-15 mins. Very reliable operation so far.	1
It came folded and the fold makes are still visible. The picture didn't should how much of a red boarder there is. Low quality.	0
What can I say? I went to WM to buy a wall mount and the cheapest one they had for my set was $89. But this one is a fraction of the cost and works fine.<br /><br />I rarely write reviews but felt compelled to do so here. This is a great product and extremely easy to assemble/install! This wall mount is great. Priced right, easy to install, and very slim & compact. The box contains clear directions and all the hardware is organized into compartments. Better than expected. The design of this wall mount is superior to the models compared with others. The mount is not visible at all even behind an ultra thin LED LCD TV.<br /><br />I purchased this mount for a Zenith 50&#34; flat panel TV. It had a VESA 400 x 400 mounting pattern. The vertical bars are two-piece, with the lower portion of the bracket needed to accommodate the 400 mm vertical spacing. Easy to hang, came with all the appropriate hardware and even came with a level! All in all, it took less than 10 minutes to get the TV on the wall. It seems to be very sturdy and it's easy to remove the TV if you have to plug anything else in.<br /><br />Overall I am very satisfied with this mount. Buy it! It's outstanding!	1
Using these allowed me to save space in my fridge and<br /><br />really kept the food fresh. I also used some of the<br /><br />smaller ones to keep my sewing items and they work really<br /><br />well with them.	1
It doesn't work as you said. Maybe I'm doing. Something wrong It looks easy watching TV. and other person. Ding for you too. Plus I have very bad shoulder so is not that easy as I thought.	1
I received Barney Miller the Complete third season in excellent condition in a timely manner. This is one of my favorite sit-coms. Would recommend this to those who likes this series.	0
I gifted this remote control police car to my son on his 10th year birthday . He was very happy to get it. This car runs very smoothly and has long battery life. The wireless remote controller is also awesome with it catching capacity upto 50 metre.	1
I received the Remo Black Suede Emperor batter in excellent condition from the seller.  I use it on my Pearl Firecracker 10" snare drum and it sounds excellent!	0
I've just recently started buying a few Invicta watches and I really like both of them.  I've purchased them through Amazon and haven't had any issue whatsoever. I've noticed a few people doing reviews on the same watches I've bought talking about how awful they were.....I just don't see it.  But then again, maybe I've just gotten lucky and not received a defective one yet.  This watch is great for someone with a midsize wrist like myself and isn't too heavy!	0
I use these for my production audio recording rig with much success. Can handle many recharges, although I have had a couple turn to duds after 1+ yr of regular use. Best high quality option.	0
This is WAY bigger than I thought it would be.Almost as big as as a Blackberry. The chain is cheap, but it was only .98, so I am not complaining. This is worth more than I paid for it, for sure. Especially since it shipped from Hing Kong. I totally recommend.	0
Definitely worth the money. They appear very sturdy and are extremely comfortable. I am strongly considering buying another pair in a different color.	0
The stitching seems to be top-notch on the patch. Only time will tell on how it holds up, but so far it has seemed more than adequate for the price paid and I will definitely be getting more! Gadsden and Culpeper got it out quickly and I would not hesitate to order from them again.	0
I stumbled upon these on Amazon recently while shopping for luggage tags for men. These are wonderful to put on your luggage while traveling. I picked red as I thought it would stand out on our black luggage. It did just that!!! We used them this week for a plane trip and we *immediately* saw our suitcases when they appeared on the luggage turnstile in our destination city.	1
Defective. Opened it and played with for 10 minutes before the green stopped working. Unfortunately, a crazy schedule after christmas didn't allow me to return it in time for a refund. My kids were really disappointed	1
This was a gift for my dad, who is a Dolphins fan (obviously). Can't really say much, its a steering wheel cover.<br /><br />After I saw a previous review, I decided to open it as soon as I got it, turns out that the smell was deadly. Other than that, felt nice, correct size, everything is good.	0
The velcro surface is very cheap, the riser broke within a week of light use (the screws stripped), the power supply wouldn't work with any of my Boss pedals due to excessive humming so I still had to power them with batteries.  You might as well save your money and spend it on a better product.	0
This isn't a book that you can read and just expect results to show up. It took some work to implement the resume ideas, and some practice to get comfortable with the interview tactics. That said, I felt like the whole book was useful, from the beginning part about setting goals and creating a vision all the way through the end with the information on getting off to a fast start on a new job. After years in a mind numbing, dead-end job, I finally have some hope that better things are ahead. Definitely worth the effort and highly recommended.	1
The moment I saw it here in amazon.com, I know exactly that I would buy it. I was very skeptic in buying gift for my niece on her birthday. I already bought a perfect gift for her but I wanted more. These very cute and lovely pouch purse was the gift to be added on the gift box. She was very thrilled when she received and can't  wait to use. I bought one with her favorite color and she was even happier. I would recommend this also to you if you are looking for lovely gifts that little girls would enjoy.	1
Nice little keyboard.  Have had no problem connecting it to my Samsung S3 or my iPad.  Quiet and smooth.  Highly recommend it!	0
My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)	1
the set does not match completely in porpotion for size, the front mats are way to big and the back bats are all to small, the liner is to narrow, this is not made for an american standard car, the mats slide alot also	1
I have owned other similar to this product and loved them. I am hoping this one is just as good. Have not used yet.	1
I ought this for my son and he loved it. It's perfect for his not-too-big room and the sound quality is great. I can hear some decent bass too. Guess it's a steal!	1
I am not sure of the historical accuracy of all the details but it sends the right message i believe.	0
I bought this as a repalcement to my old charger and I'm glad that it works good. Very reliable. I'm very pleased with my purchased.	1
This was a gift for my girlfriend.  It seems to work well and do what it is intended to do.  Looks nice.	0
My hopes for this set have been dashed by the poor quality sound and the consistent interruptions with the connection. It is not a good buy at all.	1
So glad to have this one. I didn't expect my brother would buy this for me. We just browse and explore sandals in amazon and after 2 weeks I saw this on my closet. Love this a lot! Wedge is wedge.. I really like the design and its color. Size is perfect!	1
Well, they did replace mine when it broke after using it for 3 months. I enjoyed using it very much and one day, even with proper use and careful handling, the earbud piece got separated from the hard plastic housing, and that was that. They did honor their warranty, though, so yay. I'll probably be buying something else the next time, though.	1
I had a black case, but I was always mislaying the device.  Now that it is bright red, it is hard to miss.  Does the job.	0

This gerber multitool is a great toy for me! My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a "rubber" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<br /><br />The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, "rough" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<br /><br />Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter. Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!<br /><br />Pricy? perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!	1
Fantastic Camera...Affordable, High Quality,<br />high definition and a must have for your indoor video security needs whether it be for security or recreational use.<br />The colors and clarity are very crisp and with the new Plug n Play Feature, you can set it up in just minutes. I just can't believe you get all this camera for around a $80. Just when you thought it couldn't get better, Polaroid made it happen.<br />This is a cool little camera with a big picture. easy set up and very user friendly. Well done and if you are looking for a great camera, look no further!	1
Pretty much what the title says. It's not going to make you a superstar, it's a pop filter! But it definitely holds up very well. I'm pretty aggressive with my movements because I do a lot of pod casting/video blogging so I have gone through a few filters because I have to keep adjusting and in the end they just fall apart.. Take it for what it is, a solid, sturdy, clean filter that takes a lot of punishment.	1
With temperatures going below warm and having two cats that adopted us. We wanted someting to keep them warmer than a old styrafoam container we converted to a shelter for them. Even being two grown cats they fit in just fine. Now we find them inside the cat house more than walking around in the cold. Item came just in time for dropped tempeturaes of single digits. Patches and Blue Eyes thank you from the botton of their little hearts so do we.	1
My husband loves these. They are easy to make and yield consistent results. Easy to customize the strength by just using more or less water. We bring a few packets when we go away on weekend trips. Buying in bulk here is definitely cheaper than buying at the store. Cheers!	0
Brooke is a very good instructor and explains the movements well. The movements themselves are concise and efficient and the results for less work/time, as compared to sit-ups for instance, if very good.<br /><br />Some was a little bit difficult, but was easy to pick up on after a couple of times and getting things correct.	1
I can't say I'm an expert on coffee grinders, but it seems to be working great. The item arrived on time, and is pretty much exactly what I suspected.	1
First off i got to actually play the game for 3 hours straight no problem. Which was the opening day.... for the past couple days i have unsuccessfully not connected to the servers. So i paid $80 for a demo. (i got the digital deluxe edition.) Of what i DID play its awesome....accept that you have to play with other players, NOT TRUE....you can make a private game. Or INVITE ONLY game. The problem with the online server is that only ONE of the dam areas that you can build your city works and you can only build your city on one plot of land. As far as game looks and gameplay, it's excellent. I liked how easy the menus were and its close to the other simcity gameplay. A lot of new things to go along with it too. I HATE that it does not have offline mode, i a member of the armed forces and what i do in my offtime is workout and game, and i love this game and i really dislike that i cannot play it while out to sea or deployed to places that don't have internet. (which is in May) As you all know the servers are not working...So what do you get when you have an Online game that runs on online servers that dont work? a game that doesn't work, and ultimately thats how this review is going to go for this. I paid $80 for 3 hours of working gameplay. Thank you EA and Maxim for delivering so far.. I will update and rate based on the game working....when it is actually working...but until then...1 star.	0
I haven't actually used this on a trip yet but I love all the space and compartments in the suitcase. Seems like it will work out well. Happy with my purchase. Will return for more purchases.	1
Call me a freak, but I absolutely love good, gory movies.  I just can’t help myself.  The more splatter, the better.  Films like Peter Jackson’s DEAD ALIVE or Eli Roth’s CABIN FEVER are some of my favorite splat-fests.  So when I saw the summary for CHEMICAL PEEL, I knew it was a must-see.  Chemical spills are always a great way to initiate some good gory action.  And let me tell you:  this film does not disappoint!  Chocked full of intensity and plenty of splatter, this horror flick is one you must see!<br /><br />I am very impressed with how much I enjoyed this film.  It is good on so many levels.  Great acting, intriguing premise, and excellent special effects (i.e. gore).  You just can’t ask for much more from a horror film.<br /><br />CHEMICAL PEEL starts off with a bang and it never lets up.  The tension is in the air from the get go, and it’s thick enough to feel on your skin.  I love this aspect of the film, as it puts the viewer in the midst of things right off.<br /><br />The acting is great, with a whole cast of unknowns (to me) giving top-notch performances.  I have to give particular note to Natalie Victoria, who portrays the main character, Rae.  Victoria does a stellar job as the role of the downtrodden heroine, and I hope to see more of her work in the future.  I also have to mention Arielle Brachfeld, who plays Rae’s sister, Angela.  Brachfeld does such a great job with her role, it’s almost scary.  She makes Angela into a Grade A bitch.  I can honestly say I have not wanted a character to die so badly in a long time.<br /><br />The special effects in CHEMICAL PEEL win the blue ribbon here, though.  There are several very nice gore scenes, and they don’t leave much to the imagination.  One of my favorites occurs when one of the girls decides to take a shower and wash off some of the muck in the air.  Little does she know that water is a trigger for the chemical reaction.  As a result, the girl melts (literally) in the tub.  This scene is very well done, and it will haunt my memory for a long time!<br /><br />CHEMICAL PEEL is a big win for me, and fans of horror as well as gore-hounds alike will enjoy this one.  Make sure you watch this on an empty stomach, though…even if you’re not very squeamish, some of these scenes will make you look away.  The film is available now, so give it a look.	0
&#34;This is by far the best wine opener I have found. It is made of quality material, so it should last a long time.<br />Now I no longer have to open the wine for my wife, she can open it for me.<br />I also bought one for a friend and she thinks it is the best also (no it's not my girlfriend, it is a family friend - ha, ha).&#34;	1
This bag has quickly become my favorit. Its built material is high quality, and the design is amazing. You can carry it anywhere and it is spacious. You can fit a lot of staff in there. I have literally worn many types of different objects in it, from clothes, to heavy objects like books and big water bottles. It is very durable and it fits with any type of sport outfit. Great bag that I recommend to anyone.. it can be your travel, shopping or sports bag.	1
This seemed like a huge amount of candy at one delivery. However, I pass it along to my chocoholic friends at our social events.<br />Suggestion: During summer, don't forget to put a bar in the freezer for a couple hours before eating.	1

I've used plenty of winged corkscrews in the past, and they're usually somewhat flimsy, need to be pulled on a lot, and the letral stress form the twisting motion you have to apply to get the cork out eventually breaks the corkscrew. This one is solid. While I can't claim I've used it enough to see if it stands the test of time, the cork comes out much easier, and the whole unit is built very solidly. It also fits snugly on the top of the wine bottle, and the screw is long enough that it pulls the cork out the whole way the first time so I don't have to apply any lateral pressure. If you want a winged corkscrew, this is the way to go.	0
This watch is an eye catcher.  It's big and beefy and heavy... you know you are wearing a timepiece.  Everyone who noticed my new watch was asking about it and it really sets off a casual outfit.  Pros: Cool composite band - very trendy, but cool black. Skeleton see-through is very detailed and jeweled Waterproof, so no worries in common usage around water.  Cons: Big -- not for tiny man arms. Must wind....  Perhaps I've gotten too used to self winding Clasp can be difficult to open, but it never accidentally pops.  Update 6/2015 -- I've had this watch for a long time now and it still keeps time and looks like it did on day one.  It's striking -- I get a lot of comments on this watch, much more than any other watch I own.   It really has a great look and complements casual and business casual well. I've had to maintain the band's screws to keep them tight, recently using a threadlock gel to ensure they stay in without risk.  The bezel has zero marks on it and the glass is unscratched.    That's saying a lot -- with its size, it has taken a few impacts catching edges or doorframes.   The Skeleton nature of the face is intricate with its gems and must be what draws people to the face... either way, I don't have its equal on my nightstand and it brings me to looking at some of the Invicta Reserves as a future investment.   I'm very satisfied with this watch.	0
$50 for some stinky tablets. Nothing, nada, no effect whatsoever. It's taking me awhile to write a review because I was trying to give them time to work. It wasn't until I landed up in the hospital (Not Because Of This Product) that I realized I blew 50 bucks. The Doc asked me all that I was taking and I gladly told him about this product thinking maybe it was the cause of my hospital stay (It was pneumonia) He and the nurse both sensed my fear and promptly me told me they were just glorified vitamins with big cheesy smiles on their faces. OH THE SHAME!!!!	1
Klein made in USA will last for generations. Solid quality and a cost that reflects it. Klein tools feel like their made by craftsman and this go to tool is no exception.	0
These bags are perfect.  They are just the right size and plenty strong enough.  They've got an adorable little carry case.  I like the fact that they give you a lot of bags so you don't have to buy too often.  A must for pet owners.    I wanted to add one more thing:  These are perfect size also to put a dirty diaper in. We had a yucky one and no trash close by so we put it in the bag and able to dispose of later with no mess!	1
Awesome!!  So great to have the 3/4 cup and 2/3 cup included. Seems minor i know but it just makes sense when these measuring combinations are common in recipes.  Don't let the cheap little chain ring that holds them together fool you, they are nicely made not cheap or flimsy. Would recommend this product.	0
I got this microphone to record podcasts on my computer. After plugging it in and setting it up, I recorded a short 5 minute clip to test it. When I listened back I couldn't even hear my voice and there was a crazy buzzing noise in the background. I tried calling the manufacturer for help at the number they provided me to call, and no one answered. Instead they directed me to the website for troubleshooting. Well guess what? At the website there is no MAC troubleshooting, only WINDOWS. This product says it will work with a MAC - so why no help for Mac users? So I wrote the company an e-mail asking for help. I got an auto message saying I would hear back in 24 hours. Well Four days later and no response.<br /><br />Needless to say I'm returning this item and will not purchase from this company again.	0
The instruction on loading photos on to digital frame is really not clear, this item was purchased for last Christmas and I still do not have pictures loaded on to frame. I have considered returning item.	1
Used them to make custom burp cloths because of their absorbency. When I washed them, they shrank a little more than hoped for but they still turned out cute.	0
Using this wall mounted in my man cave.  Using this with an apple tv, and a dvd player.  The picture quality is very nice.  It is light weight and easy to mount too my wall mount.  Setup was easy and intuitive.  Matching the setup protocol on my other Samsung tvs.<br /><br />The sound quality on this tv is outstanding.  It is one of the first I have every bought where I have no desire to add a sound bar or external speakers.  The sound is very crisp and quite loud.<br /><br />I wish tv manufactures placed all of the inputs on the back.  When the hdmi and usb plugs are on the side it creates cord clutter.<br /><br />I have had good luck with samsung tv sets.  I also own a 52 inch plasma and a 42 inch lcd.  The first is now two years old and the second is three years old.  Both have worked just fine without any issues.  It is because of my two prior tv sets that I chose this one.	0
You will be pleasantly surprised to learn of the excellent engineering standard of this product. Really, rather good.	1
I love this type of pant.  Hassel free and comfortable.  These fit the bill.  I must have thought I ordered petite and didn't.  I wear boots so it is no big deal.  They are only an inch or two longer than I like.	0
Cloud Atlas brings us tales of anger, betrayal, love, death and the moments that somehow become intertwined that none of us could ever have forseen coming.  With a vast cast playing various parts though out the entire film and somehowed linked to each and every one of them.  Based of the same novel we are given to a series of events that take place in various points in time on Earth.<br />  A young man is on a voage home in the year 1738 to conclude busniess for his father in law and to be his loving wife once more.  MEanwhile a stow away is trying to get the young man to help save him from slavery in the new lands. And a doctor that has dark designs on what the young man is traveling with.<br />  We are also introduced to a young man from England in the year 1933 leaving his gay lover to work with an elderly conductor in the hopes of one day becoming famous himself and the search for his own talent.  However will his lifestyle be his undoing as he works under the iron fist of a man who may already be washed up himself?<br />  A female jounrnalist discovers from 1972 a man she was trapped in the elvator with has been found dead and discovers that he may have information leading to a disater that could hurt hundreds of people.  In doing so she comes into the corsshairs of powerful people who want her dead and anyone else she's told of her discoveries.<br />  The year is 2012 and a washed up publisher has just witnessed his author kill a noted reviwer for the simple fact he didn't like the book.  With his author in jail and he reaping the rewards of a book that has become a best seller and the author's family demands a cut of the money he has earned.

And in doing so the man begins to see that past mistakes can be changed by future ones.<br />  These tales while simple in thier description are truly complex by watching them.  From start to end we witness all these events and see how they  shape one another.  This is a very moving movie and one that has to be watched to understand the sheer scope of it all.  With no one actor standing out and each taking on secondary roles as the stories permit and truly something great to watch.	0
Great for. Big family like mine! Very strong and works like a charm. This is a,so very easy install and to use. Will recommend for all whose home needs one.	1
This waterless car was is out standing. Every easy and delivers results instantly. Always remember to keep flipping your microfiber towels as you wipe on your car. Best is when car body is cool, if it's a little too warm it's a bit challenging and results won't be the same as if it cool. It's also a very good detailing product after wash.	0
The scent is great, the cost is not. We have several electric dispensers around the house and we love the automatic spray, but the cost makes the purchase infrequent.	0
It's a big improvement over the pump-spray variety of mister, for at least two reasons.  1 - You are ready to go immediately, you don't have to pump it.  Often when cooking you need to keep things moving, it's not convenient to have to take a break to pump up your oil mister.  2- More importantly, the pump misters aren't very durable, I've gone through several of them.  The stress caused by pumping them (you need a lot of pressure) eventually leads to failure of the piston or some other part.  I do love it. I may buy a second one so I can keep two kinds of oil handy.  I'd put extra-virgin olive oil in one and high-heat canola in the other.  EDITED: 2 weeks after I got it and 1 day after I wrote the above 5-star review (and I ordered a second one as described above), it broke after falling 6 inches onto a tile floor.  A 6-inch fall was enough to break the top off at the glass neck.  So, durability is very poor.  Good thing I ordered a second one. I'm removing 2 stars.  Cuisinart:  MAKE IT STRONGER OR GIVE IT SOME PROTECTION!  A silicone outer-sleeve would be just right.	0
had to get a few more after my last few expired. I have only had to use my once which is good, but it made a nasty dog run for the hills after it tried to bite my 7 year old son.	1
Like many movies from the 80's The Wizard is cheesy but fun to watch. the older you get the more you may not find it so amusing, but kids should enjoy it time and time again.	1
I have bought several products from this seller and I have been pleased with all of them. The green coffee does exactly what it says it does! I am happy with it and will purchase another once I am finished with this bottle.	1
Shocked at how heavy duty and secure this lock box is. Fits 5 of my keys no problem. Will buy these in the future instead of the expensive Masterlock ones. Same functionality as Masterlock for cheaper.	1
Just when you think you can never get enough information... read<br />this if you have scoliosis. It's an easy read and well organized for<br />"quick look-ups".	1
great non stick mold.  This instantly classes up any cake, making it so much prettier and presentable.	1
So I've never played dragon age before but I have playedcelder scrolls on ps3 before which is why I got this game. And if you did like elder scrolls this will disappoint.<br />Pros: Great graphics, Ok story/plot, multiplayer option.<br /><br />Cons: Bland gameplay. (Your character can only use certain weapons so a mage could only use magic and swordsman can only use swords, which is a big con. You could switch characters but it's not same thing.), Not that many skills to improve upon.	0
Odd Man Out, 1947 film<br /><br />It starts with a view of a rural area, then a large city. A man walks into an apartment. Men are planning an action to get funds. Pistols will be needed, if necessary. Johnny got 17 years for gun running until he escaped. Has he changed? “When I want your advice I’ll ask for it.” [Fatal arrogance?] Three men enter the office of a factory to rob the payroll. But Johnny hesitates, an armed man catches him! There is a struggle, shots are fired. Johnny is wounded, the other man is dead. Johnny falls off the car when it makes a fast turn on the street. The police set up a dragnet to catch the robbers. There are excuses and arguments among the robbers. Who is to blame? Johnny McQueen hallucinated in an air raid shelter. A young girl sees him when she retrieves a soccer ball. Elsewhere the other men flee from a police search. They find a house for refuge.<br /><br />A young couple enter the air raid shelter. They don’t want to get involved with Johnny. Theresa gets information from the two men. [Do they talk too much?] Can they trust her? They leave the house, there is shooting! No survivors. Young boys play and fight in the street. Dennis questions them. [This tell about the boy’s lives.] Dennis finds Johnny and tells him how to escape after he draws the police away in a dramatic chase. Dennis signals Johnny. [Who was the better leader?] Dennis boards a bus, the police catch him. Elsewhere Johnny is found by two women who have medical training and treat him for his “accident”. “Why should I be the one to bring him in?” Tom has no sympathy for Johnny. Johnny chooses to leave and avoid trouble. The police check the Identity Cards of all adult males. The police search that apartment and ask about Johnny. “He belongs to the law now.”<br /><br />Johnny is dropped off at a monuments work yard. A man sees this. Kathleen continues her search. She is being watched by the police. Can Father Tom help? That man has a sick bird,his left wing is hurt. [The talk is symbolic.] “Will faith pay the rent?” Kathleen wants to take Johnny away, out of the country. [Is that possible?] Can she protect him? Snow falls, Johnny walks into a saloon and is put in a private room. Shell returns to his room, Lukey stops him; he wants to paint Johnny. Shell looks for Johnny and enters that saloon. A scream attracts attention. This saloon closes at 10 PM sharp! Lukey is impressed to get rid of Johnny. Kathleen Sullivan talks to a ship’s captain about a passenger. Johnny hallucinates again. “He’s mad.” Shell leads Johnny outside. Will he stay put? Kathleen runs to find him. “Go back to life, please.” Men with searchlights approach. Will Kathleen and Johnny go away together? Or will there be a tragic ending?<br /><br />This movie has some interesting characters to pad out this story, but it still runs on too long. Some of the scenes have the lighting that was common to crime movies of the 1940s. Using the viewpoint of the robbers wasn’t new (“The Asphalt Jungle” was a better movie). This movie shows life in the tenements of Belfast. They did not explain the sickness of Johnny. Did a brain disease cause his blurred vision and fainting?	0
Very satisfied with the product. My 4 year old miniature dachshund suffered a disk injury and was beginning to show signs of nerve damage and paralysis in her hind legs even with a course of steroids and strict cage rest. I needed to quickly decide between surgery and conservative, alternative treatment. After research I decided to use a combination of the Ligaplex II, Vetri-Science Vetri-Disc, strict cage rest, and acupuncture. I sprinkled one capsule of each on her food twice daily. I'm happy to say that she has made a full recovery. I continue to add this to her food since dachshunds are known for their disc problems. People who saw her when she was &#34;down&#34; are amazed by the results.	0
Lots of good stuff on the extra DVD's, if you are looking for more then is included with the 2 disk version you have certainly found it.	1
Purchased this watch to give to my son. Looks nice but hope the clasp on the band holds up, it does not look that sturdy. Other wise this product is a great value towards an inexpensive gift for a loved one.	1
This purchase was a perfect replacement for the safety belt in our Graco highchair. Just wish there was a choice in color.	0
Nice coffee table, awesome color. My dog got on it with his paws and it did not scratch so quality of make is good too!	1
We have ordered and recieved the crib and changing table.  Both seem very nice and well built.  Assembly went very well.  We have also ordered and received the matching chest of drawers.	0
I've talked to my dentist about it but he just suggested using whitening product on regular basis. I choose this Brilliant HD and it makes my teeth become whiter. I will continue to use it.	1
I gave these goggles as a gift to my brother's kids. They are participating in the swimming team and they spend a lot of time training every day so I thought that this will be a great gift for them. They were very happy and after using them at the training sessions, they told me that these are the best goggles they ever got. They said that the goggles are perfect and the straps adjustment is very easy. They liked the blue color very much because it is their favorite color. As they are using them for some time now, they didn't broke and the quality didn't change. I liked the one year quality guarantee, it is a great offer but I didn't use it till now. The visibility is very good for outdoor usage while it is not as good when used indoor, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Over all, they are well made where they protect the eyes perfectly. I highly recommend this great product. Thumbs Up	1
This is the Eddie Murphy I love! I mean, nowadays, he's Norbit and the Klumps, but this one was really golden. A lot of quotable lines that I use everyday and it's still funny every time I watch it!	1
I was really disappointed in the Panasonic DMC-ZS45K Lumix.  I had really high hopes for it as the functionality that is listed in the description really makes it sound like a great point and shoot camera.  I have experience with lots of different digital cameras, from the more sophisticated D-SLR cameras to the simplest disposables.  So I was really let down with this one.<br /><br />First off, for the casual user who just wants a simple point and shoot camera, I would not recommend this.  Panasonic did a horrible job of making the basic camera functions as complex as possible, requiring several steps to making adjustments that other cameras innately have available with one click or turn of a dial.  However, even if this wasn't an issue, which after a few days of use it became a little easier to remember where certain features were located, the biggest problem that I have with this camera overall is the horrible delay between pressing the shutter release button and time it takes the camera to snap the photograph.  This drove me crazy on my old freebie smart phone, so when this decently priced camera did it I was really shocked.  Basically what happens is you go to take a picture of say your children, so you line them up, tell them to smile, and push the button, you can almost count to two before the camera takes the picture.  At this point everyone has moved and the picture comes out all wrong or blurry.  It's really a shame.  I even switched the setting over to &#34;action&#34; so that it would increase the shutter speed time, and the results were exactly the same.  So if you tried to use the &#34;action&#34; mode to catch a thrilling shot at a sporting event or something, the picture would be about two seconds later than the one you tried to take!  At that timing, what's the point?<br /><br />I tried playing with the &#34;WINK&#34; setting for taking selfies, and that also needs some more engineering from Panasonic.  It works, but barely.  After setting the camera to take a picture using a &#34;wink&#34; (in the same menu as the countdown mode) you have to really be patient with it, and stand there looking like a crazy person winking slowly at your camera in an over emphasized manner in order for the camera to start a 3 second countdown to take the picture.  Even then, I could only get it to take a picture once every ten or so attempts.  Or you could just set the camera to countdown mode, press the shutter button, and the 3 second countdown happens exactly the same way.<br /><br />For more experienced photographers, Panasonic didn't help you out either.  The manual settings for adjusting aperture and shutter speed require four different steps, toggling between menu functions in order to make your adjustments.  It really shouldn't be that difficult to do these kind of changes, and really wastes a lot of good opportunities by forcing you to do them.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheaper cameras that take great pictures with so much less hassle.	0
This product is fantastic!!!! Quiet and stylish. My watch hasn't stopped yet!!!! This product is a great value with multiple options for when you would like for it to rotate.	0
Love it! Heavy duty case seems to be very well built! I would recommend this case to any body looking for a good case. It holds my iphone with a protection box on it.	0
This workout is really hard! It is not so hard, though, that I don't want to keep trying. It is nice to have one of workout friends doing an easier version of the moves and her other friend doing the advanced version. Some of the moves I could do better than the others, so it was nice to see different difficulty of the moves.	1
So this in the cinema and have to say, pretty disappointed.  The only good thing about the movie was H Berry, but beyond that it was predictable and lame.	1
The balloon was not the same as the one in the picture. Outlines on Hello Kitty were gold instead of black. It was an obvious bootleg. The size was smaller than stated as well. It doesn't come inflated, for obvious reasons, so you have to get it inflated; however, they had the genuine Hello Kitty balloons at the market that were the same &#34;smaller&#34; size I received. So... all in all it was a waste of time and money because general stores try not to fill non-store bought balloons. A big hassle, although, the balloon costs less than a dollar.	0
I purchased a can of this locally on a whim with low expectations since it was in a can. Frankly, I was delightfully surprised by how flavorful it is.<br /><br />To the folks whose reviews claim that this is mis-labeled hummus instead of baba ghanouj - I disagree. Perhaps the confusion comes from the denser consistency of this product. If you follow the directions by adding some olive oil and lemon and thoroughly mixing it in, then the consistency will be that of a well made baba ghanouj. The directions also call for mixing in crushed garlic, which is essential to achieve an authentic flavor. I believe those ingredients were left out of the can and left to the buyer to increase shelf life.<br /><br />After mixing in the lemon juice, olive oil and crushed garlic I also add a pinch of cumin into the mix. Right before serving I will sometimes sprinkle cumin or summac over the top for an added flavor as well as drizzle more olive oil over the top of the baba ghanouj in the serving dish or bowl.<br /><br />There are a few nutritional facts you should take into account: there are about ten servings in a can, and each one contains 180mg of sodium. If you are on a low sodium diet you need to be careful of how much you consume. Also each serving contains 2.5 grams of fat of which a half gram is saturated. This is BEFORE you add olive oil, which will raise the fat content per serving by another 14 grams of fat per tablespoon of oil used when you mix the baba ghanouj. Each of the ten servings is 40 calories before adding in the olive oil, which contains an additional 140 calories per tablespoon.<br /><br />While the above nutritional facts look dismal, bear in mind that they are about par for any properly prepared baba ghanouj - although you can control the sodium content by making this dish from scratch. Although my diet is restrictive I can break the rules occasionally when I want baba ghanouj but am too lazy to make it myself. Used in moderation this is an excellent alternative and one that is authentic if you follow the directions and mix in the missing ingredients and garnish to taste. And it's an inexpensive alternative as well as a convenient one.	0
Ghouls Rule Draculaura<br /><br />I've been avoiding doing this line of Dolls for awhile now, simply because their outfits are so detailed.  I know the reviews are going to be wordy with all the detail and description needed.  It's now time to put on my big girl boots and just get it over with.<br /><br />The basics... Draculaura comes with a stand, hairbrush and a small cardboard card .  A Ghoul's Rule, DVD animation still of Draculaura is on one side. The other side has movie versions of Cleo, Clawdeen, Frankie and Draculaura.<br /><br />At first I was resistant of these dolls, since they were a bit expensive and I was using all spare amounts of cash to find the older MH Dolls I wanted to have in my collection. After eying them for months in various stores I finally caved and bought most of the set. Ever the faithful Frankie fan I rarely find another doll prettier, however this Draculaura steals the show in the Ghoul's rule set.<br /><br />Draculaura wears the dress from the Ghoul's Rule DVD every detail expertly matched.  The dress has a white ruched bodice with off the shoulder sheer black sleeves. The large pink collar of her dress along with the black ribboning is plastic and removable, functioning more like a necklace This enables the dress too go from Gothic couture too regular couture with it's removal.<br /><br />The mini skirt of her dress is comprised of three layers. The top most layer is sheer black tulle with a velvet, bat winged, heart design. From the sides and back of black tulle stems a longer train of sheer black fabric, the metallic silver and pink in the spiderweb, vine design, shimmers in the light. The second layer is a shimmering pink that sits atop the third  and final layer of sheen pink.<br /><br />Draculaura sports sheer hot pink tights that fade to black, mid calf. Her shoes perfectly match her attire, being clear with black spiderweb design and  pink,zipper detailing. The actual heel of her shoe is solid black and looks similar to a fang.<br /><br />The wings of Draculaura's outfit are fitted onto her shoulders and like the collar are re-movable. The large bat wings are black  which fades to pink as it gets closer to the tips. A see-through spider web design is cut into the moveable wings. ( Yep, that's right! You can pose the wings to the sides, straight back or somewhere in the middle.)<br /><br />Counted among her other accessories are a small skullette doll, a pink skullette trick or treat basket and her black and pink masquerade mask. I am happy to report the doll can hold the mask independently and is easily posed with it.<br /><br />Draculaura's hair is a huge misfire however. The wig is long and full but the tight spiral curls are a mess after getting her un-boxed. Brushing out the curls only makes them frizzy. This is one of the few times I wish Mattel heavily sprayed a doll's wig. This particular Draculaura also only has one single streak of trademark pink rooted  into the black wig The streak accompanies the pink found in her midnight black bangs.<br /><br />Overall I love this doll! Very happy to have her in my collection. As with any of the deluxe MH dolls. I feel like they are made more for the older MH fans as opposed to the younger ones. The Outfits are very sensitive to play and small pieces can be easily lost or broken.  If you don't have this Draculaura and your a fan of the Character...Pick her up Today!!!	0
Bought this to replace an LG player that was failing to load many Netflix Blu Ray discs. The new player is much smaller than the old one and starts up faster.<br /><br />So far the Panasonic has loaded and played all the discs I've fed it. Blu Ray discs load pretty quickly and the picture quality is excellent. I've used both the YouTube and Amazon Instant Video apps to watch videos via WiFi. Both played without any glitches. The Amazon video showed some compression artifacts especially in darker scenes, but was acceptable.<br /><br />The player has only HDMI output. I would have liked optical audio output but I was able to adjust my setup to accommodate it.<br /><br />The remote works out-of-the-box with my Panasonic Viera TV, so I don't need to dig out the TV remote just to switch inputs. On the other hand, I hate the placement of the 3 buttons around the navigation buttons. They have the same shape and feel as the nav buttons. I don't know how many times I've opened the Netflix app when I meant to press the up button.	0

It fits perfect and shipping was fast. It is very warm and comfortable. It blocks the wind very well. I want to get this for all the guys in the family this year!	1
i really thought I was going to love this but I hate it. The water taste horrible still and it is always in the way when trying to put a large pan under the faucet.	1
The forever rants and pseudo rebellious spirit of Holden Caulfield are flimsy. This book didn't age well or transition into today's world like some of Salinger's other works did. Still, if you're going to read the whole NY collection, you have to start here. I recommend plowing through it and moving on to the next one.	1
My printer read this ink just as it was name brand and the ink levels seems pretty accurate, which is hard to find with remanufactured cartridges. I haven't received an error message yet and it is printing nicely.	1
Super cute colored film borders to use with the instant film camera Instax. I was surprised that the camera did not come with any instant film, and I had to buy this as an add on. I like that the offer colored film borders as well as the standard white. Great value buying the 2 pack!	0
We got these because we needed some light over the sink.  When you stand there, the main light is blocked by your body and just isn't bright enough.<br /><br />This package comes with 2 screws for each like and a mental plate that the light magnetizes to.  They only take 3 batteries per light, instead of the 6 per light that the Duracell pack requires.  And they do come down easily to be used as a flashlight.<br /><br />So glad I bought them, what a deal!	0
Hardflip is an inspirational movie that teaches us that we can achieve anything just by slowly breaking all the obstacles standing in our way. Despite our circumstances, we are able to alone by solving our short term problems move to the highest peak of success ever. This is shown in Hardflip when Caleb a young skater is trying to become a sponsored skater, but recent problems such as his mother falling ill and his long absent father reappearing stand in his way like a dead end street. However the choices Caleb makes will decide whether or not these obstacles are the real issue. Realizing that no problem is great enough to prevent us from becoming who we are or want to be is the first lesson to understand.	1
My two-year-old daughter loves this stuffed wonder-pet, and I must say that the smile she gets on her face when it calls her by name and sings her a song is priceless.  I didn't have the problem that some did with setting up the toy, since our daughter's name was in the database.  She absolutely loves this toy, drags it around the house and is constantly hugging and squeezing it and telling it she loves it.  It's cute as a button, the perfect size and really does a lot for the price, so I can't complain.  You can log in your child's favorite colors and animals and foods and it will sing a song about them to her.  It also has a variety of other songs you can chose from for it to sing, and it will also play your child bedtime music.<br /><br />My one issue is the same issue I have with many battery operated stuffed toys; the Velcro back rarely every stays closed.  It's irritating to have the back constantly hanging open and the battery pack falling out.  No matter how many times I squeeze it tight and Velcro it, it comes undone in mere minutes.  But, as far as interactive toys go, this one is a keeper.	0
Saw similar ring in Monterey for $80.00 each. Can't tell any difference from the expensive ones. Beautiful	0

This is my favorite luggage because I travel almost every week for work and the size fits my needs. It's not too big but enough to accommodate stuff good for 4-5 days, which is my usual travel length. It's very lightweight but you can see the sturdiness inside out. I've already been using this for 2 years and it's still as good as new. It's very spacy and has complete support. Very easy to wash/clean and very easy to store because of the compact design. It rolls smoothly too. It never gave me any trouble so far.	1
The screw covers really gave a nice look on my car!!!!<br />Is easy to install , and the finish is amazing!!!!<br />Thanks!!	0
I had to re-ordered a half size up.  However, once I got the half size up I have PRed 3 lifts this week.	0
I so love this bracelet. My sister gave this to me last week and my friends keep on asking me where did I buy this. This product is awesome. Its looking good!	1
I could only wear it once since it showed since of almost breaking. It’s okay though since I needed it only that one time for a play. I looked great and did great, and this thing played a huge part.	1
Order arrived quickly. Item worked perfectly! I would recommend this to anyone needing to replace their LNB on a SlimLine Dish.	0
These are a decent little pair of binoculars. The light gathering power is not enormous, but I was able to see night sky objects well, andromeda galaxy and the Pleiades star cluster looked nice. They fold up and are fairly compact. Good for daylight viewing and bird watching, not the best out there, but good for being very inexpensive.	1
Okay, I bought this for a friend thinking it would be a novelty gift.  I tried it, loved it, and bought another one for me!  I probably look a little funny using it, but it feels fantastic.  I have my head massager on top of my nightstand.  A couple of swipes of this on my head and I'm ready for bed.  This is not to be used in front of others, as your friends will see your groan and roll your eyes as you use this.  Yes, it feels that good.	0
Bought this in Italy when i was there and was able to buy a few more bottles since I came home it is so good	0
When I drink coffee , it has to be a bold dark roast.  I enjoy columbian and french roasts, but the Ethiopian has all the bold flavor without the bite that you find with the others.  It is smooth, and rich, and wonderful.	0
This rug was a very good deal. It feels really wonderful under foot and I have even dropped a soda on it. It cleaned up real easy. I think it is also very pretty and not over powering to the room.	1
Perfect for the room to hang all my purses, it's amazing how much stuff you can hang up, the color was perfect with my furniture, and I love it, looks very strong and easy to assemble. I have long wanted to have one of those and it has a perfect price.	1
This carrier has been great. There are three main things I love about it.<br /><br />1. It was a waist belt. A lot of carriers that can have the baby front facing only have the shoulder straps. Those kill your back after a while. I can hold my 20 pound baby for quite a while with no back pain.<br /><br />2. It's really easy to adjust. My husband and I both use this product quite often. My husband is about 8 in. taller than me, so this is a must for us. Not only is it easy to adjust, it's pretty quick too.<br /><br />3. There are several carrying positions. There are 4 to be exact. Facing you narrow seat, facing you wide seat, facing out, and backpack. The facing you narrow seat is great when the baby is too small to wrap their legs around you. This is a problem with most ergonomic baby carriers. Then when the baby is big enough, you can use the facing you wide seat, which is the safest position for babies in carriers-especially for longer periods of time. Facing out is great when baby can hold their head up and want to explore. I haven't used the backpack carry yet, but I imagine that will be very helpful as my baby grows.<br /><br />There's only one drawback in this carrier. It's hard to change from the wide seat to the narrow seat. It's very hard to get the toggles and buttons through the holes. This may just be to keep the carrier more secure though, so it may be a good thing.<br /><br />It's a great carrier. I'd recommend it to anyone.	0
I replaced some older plastic slides on the bottom of a repurposed table.  Love these gliders.  I use them on a rough slate tile floor.  Terrific choice!	0
Whoever designed the remote control sleep mode feature needs to be fired. What were they thinking? How can you train a dog when the remote goes into sleep mode after a minute? I have to push and hold the button of the remote to wake it up for few seconds before I could correct the dog and most of the time it's already too late as the dog is already done misbehaving. So unless your dog needs correction every minute, the collar will not be ready when you need to correct a behavior. This is such a waste of time.	1
Hi All,<br /><br />This will be quick and smooth. This isn't the best bluetooth receiver I've ever used, but the customer service I received knocks this to five stars. Be careful with the ear buds, they are easily lost and fall off. And that's where the customer service comes in. I lost all of my ear buds: they would fall off when the headset was clipped to my shirt, just lying around, etc.<br /><br />I emailed customer service and was sent four new buds plus another little pouch for the headset. Cool huh? Other than that, this is a serviceable headset (for the price) that picks up well and seems to cancel outside noise well, too.	0
Wow, Sam loves it!  I have a long haired something (not sure what, it is a mix of what looks like about 5 breeds!)  Anyway, we love him and love to spoil him.  This brush has really done a great job on helping to eliminate shedding and keep his coat healthy.  And, it really has given him a new perspective on "special time" HAHA.  He comes and sits next to me and gives me that "look" and I know it is time to pull out the brush!	1
I actually bought three of these at once, so that I could hook up my XLR mics in my home studio. I am a sound engineer for one band, and we go through cables in a hurry. I have done my share of repairs on cables and wanted to see the guts and stripped one down. The ends are soldered like they should be. I am always in a need of new hardware like this that is a very high quality, and an even better deal! Unless some fool cuts it in half i don't expect any trouble.	1
After binging on seasons 1-4 in a single week, my wife and I finally sat down to enjoy the glory of Season 5.<br /><br />After watching the first 5 episodes, my wife turned to me and asked me if this season was meant to punish us because we were Community fans and we wanted a fifth season. I mean, Dan Harmon may be back, but the stories aren't what they used to be. The light-hearted escapism prevalent in the past have been replaced with something very heavy-handed and trying too hard.<br /><br />The other reviewer was right. It's probably time for everyone to leave Greendale. Just wrap it up and quit while they're ahead.	1
This is an excellent watch at an extremely low price. It's solid and well made, and also very accurate for an automatic watch.	1
I couldn't wait to open it. It was well packaged and shipped. I opened and read the booklet with it and then plugged it in. I had to reconfigure some settings in Cakewalk with audio output and once I did that this thing was a beautiful piece of work.	1
These are very cute Kids Flip Flops by Mottos! I really love them! They came packaged so cute. Perfect for giving as a gift. I bought these for my son and he was so excited to get these in the mail. They come in such a colorful lunch box type box with a handle so you can carry it around. It also comes with a cute and useful black lightweight bag/backpack to carry things in. My son is 7 years old and wears a size 4-4.5 shoe. I ordered the size 5 Mottos flip flops. I wish these were just a bit bigger for him as they just barely fit. They are a slimmer type fit which is good for some people but for my son they were a bit narrow. Definitely order a size larger and you should be just fine. From what I saw, size 5 was the largest size available for me to order so that is why I choose size 5. My son really likes the cute charm that this comes with. He got a monkey on a surfboard. It is probably really fun to buy more charms and then be able to switch them. These seem very well made and like they will last. I am happy I made the purchase!	1
A bit flimsy.  I could not locate the heavy duty one of this tools to purchase.  This will not be able to free stuck valves without cracking - my opinion.	0
The big iPhone 6 Plus needs to be fully protected because you don't want it to be destroyed due to no coverage or protection provided. That's why this hybrid transparent case is the best one for it. It supplies your phone with all around protection giving no access for any type of damage to the sides, corners, and edges. Your phone will be completely flawless as soon as you put this case on because your entire device will be sealed up. No other clear cases will give you this amount of protection. Only Enther's Ultimate Cushion cases. It is inexpensive yet amazing quality. You will definitely see the quality difference as soon as you use this case.	1
Firstly the customer service is simply fantastic. the fastest and the promising service impressed me so much.  This one is very nice and easy to use, I've been impressed for the audio quality as well, finally I can enjoy watching my movies on my tablet with a very good audio quality.	1
I love this product!  I am no longer self-conscience about my legs.  I can wear skirts and dresses without wearing dark stockings or feeling embarrassed.  I finally have my life and my body back!  I'm glad I found and used Varidux.  I love this product.  It is such a life saver!  Without this product, I think I would have ran and hid in a cave.  Varicose veins are embarrassing, but with this product, I am not embarrassed or ashamed, and you don't have to be either.	1
Worked right out of box. Pump seemed to be new but could not tell as box was not have factory seal. I would liked to have item better packaged for shipping. But the main thing is it works :)	0
I love the design of this waterbottle. Works well and can take some fall damage. It looks great and it is easy to clean. You can use your own fruits :D Great bottle and looking forward to using it for a long time.	1
This is a perfect pet barrier. My cat is very active and likes to jump into my lap and sleep while im driving and it really can cause accidents. It is made from very durable material and has storage on it as well. Fits my car perfectly.	1
I am using this product for four months now and I can say I am very satisfied with the quality of this product. The installation was straightforward. I had to drill 1/2 hole through my cabinet side to connect the hot water hose. The installation took about 15 minutes. The supplied fittings were handy and the hose was more than enough to connect the cold and hot water. I did not have any leaks after installations. My kids loved the bidet so much that they started using the master bath (I bought one initially to test the bidet). Now I am going to buy 2 more for the other bathrooms.	1
Tried all the other brands but none compare to these classic Playtex gloves.  They fit better, do not get<br />water inside them so easily and are durable.	0
This salt is so good. I have replaced my regular old iodine salt with this stuff and it is a noticeable change. It's way better for you too!	1
Bought this for my first Jeep Jamboree not having a lot of time to mount a full sized CB.  It worked Great for our group.  If you are not wanting insane long range this will work quite well for occasional use.  Never used it out walking around though.	0
My problem really isn't with the film at all. I had the old good Miramax DVD version and sold it on ebay right before I picked this one up. I actually was really disappointed with the transfer of this film. It really doesn't look any better than the DVD version I had. Well, slightly better, but not worth the upgrade. Some films by Echo Bridge, like &#34;Venom&#34; look really good, but some do not. This is one that does not	0
Great quality, amazing taste...no bitterness at all. I like to mix it equal parts with Tulsi and Rooibus, with a slice of ginger.	0
I love this watch so much . it features bueatiful glass and case with  cutting  flower desige,and a crystal marked 12 o 'clock. gold-tone makes it fashionable and attractively . awesome watch!	1
these smell like gasoline, its A horrible smell, I agree with other guy they are greasy no matter how many times you wash it, it wont help	1
I took this along with Raspberry ketones and neither one of them seemed to have an effect on me. I'll keep it up but I am just not having the luck I had hoped for.	1
Just received my pair of sunglasses in the mail and love it! It came in a case with a cleaning cloth. I was amazed with how nice it was and how quickly I received them! Very happy with my purchase :)	1
This is a great reminder for our teen age daughter of her morality. Thank you for supplying such great products.	0
This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky).<br /><br />Another great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash.<br /><br />I like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well.	0
i love the ring very much can beat the price for a real sapphire and white topaz  stones real sterling sliver	1
Bought the 50ft for my front yard, its the best one on the market. I have used another brands but no one had the qaulity like the rumford gardener.	1
Works well but not the loudest thing ever. For $10 though, its a great deal. We have 3 of them for our bathrooms.	0
Has an adjustable temperature setting. very useful,safe and reliable. this is just what i needed to heat water for my small fodder system. Another great find.	1
These retractable ratchet straps are the best there is.  I now own 16 of them, and use them for everything.  They are the only way I strap down quads now.  They are also invaluable for strapping anything down in the bed of a truck.  I highly recommend them to everyone.	0
We just love this comforter set.  It was delivered quickly, at a wonderful price.  Everything was as described.  The comforter is not very heavy, which is what we wanted.  Everything is very well made and simply looks great.  The color scheme is exactly as the picture shows.  This is an excellent set.	0
Hope this movie will be a nice 3D nature video, spending good chunk of its time showing scenery within Grand Canyon. I'm very appreciative of the effort of the filmmaker for putting this together in 3D.<br />Hope this movie will be released soon !	1
I did receive and am very happy with this rug pad. It is working out very well for me. The size and the quality are both great and exactly what I was expecting.	1
We recently ordered these pouches for our 1 and 2 year old sons. They do well in the dishwasher, store nicely and the kids love them. My only suggestion would be that I wish they came with a device to fill the pouches as I am still improving my filling technique:) I highly recommend these amazing pouches and my boys agree!	0
As advertised.  You will be pleased if you buy this pan.  Sturdy and well made.  Would easily buy another one.	0
I came down with a nasty head cold a few days ago.<br />My nose has been like a faucet.<br />My sister told me to go buy some garlic.<br />I was worried that I'd get garlic body odor comments from my coworkers but so far no one has said a word.<br />My nose has finally shut itself off.<br />So far so good.<br />Cheap.<br />Effective.<br />Recommended.	0
Great quality for the price. Awesome deal on a multi-tool pocket knife. Strong blade with a clip on the side to hook on your things to carry it around.	1
I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn't quite for one reason - the buttons.<br /><br />To give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room.  To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace.  The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern.  The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room.  So those don't get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes.<br /><br />So lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well.  The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED's now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I'm in just fine.  But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don't provide enough light.  That's about the only time I usually turn on the others.<br /><br />I thought if I had a remote for them, I'd be more likely to use them when needed for other things.<br /><br />This is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location.  The others were just too bulky to fit within the &#34;standard&#34; box the builders used here for the wall switch.  This is the first that fit, and it didn't even have to be crammed in there.  It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer.<br /><br />The wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more.  Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on.<br /><br />The remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote.<br /><br />It works well.  I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness.  The &#34;favorite&#34; raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time,  The remote is responsive and accurate - I've not had any misfires.<br /><br />Now the reason I took a star off - the buttons.  I really hate the feel of them.  There's a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions.  So it always feels like it's about to come loose or something.  They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges.  The other downside is that there is no &#34;favorite&#34; or &#34;last&#34; setting for the wall switch itself.  I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that's just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch.  This one doesn't have the same functionality unfortunately.<br /><br />My other wishlist item would've been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark.  But the LED's are only on if the light is on.  The whole &#34;raised icon&#34; to &#34;easily find in the dark&#34; really seems pretty useless to me - if you've already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you've ALREADY found the switch...<br /><br />Apparently the CFL's I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off.  This wouldn't even work with them as a simple on/off switch.  But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED's, as these were the only cans left that I hadn't swapped to LED yet.<br /><br />But as I said, this is the first switch I've tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall.  It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.	0
My hubby is no pro but he does love his games so I got him this to help him improve his performance. He seems to be using it fairly regularly too.	1
I bought these for my husband and son who didn't want to carry around an extra wallet.  Now their cards are protected and they fit nicely in their wallets.	0
Def not worth low stars or reviews... This thing is large and solid, perfect for the loft I live in. Fits all of my stuff and I have a pretty extensive wardrobe. Wood is press board, but it's quality pressboard and not a deal breaker. And yes, it's a bit difficult to assemble with some pieces not pre drilled. It took me and a friend about 4-ish hours to put together and we are handy and have contractor tools. If you're gonna spend the $$ on this just spend the extra 100-150 to get a furniture builder or handyman to put together for you. Instructions, when there is something typed out for you which is slim to none... are in Portuguese, made in Brazil. Overall, maybe it's a BIT overpriced and a brain teaser to assemble, but you'll be hard pressed to find something this large and awesome that holds so much for cheaper.	0
I really like the curtains specially the colors. My daughter used them at a party she hosted. It was a success! Quality not all that great but then they are not for regular use.	1
I bought this the day I purchased my S6. I wasn't sure what type of fancy case I wanted, so this seed like a low budget protector until I found exactly what I wanted. However, it's great enough to where I may just stick with it.	1
I love this protein shaker..it even has a little container at the bottom as a bonus. Not only does it look cool, it also has my fave colors. I use this daily for my breakfast shakes.	1
As another reviewer stated, this isn't quite as elegantly shaped as it is pictured - it is a bit more angular. But, it looks MUCH better than all the plastic drop checkers that are available for similar prices. I'm not willing to pay what the real name brands want for a glass drop checker.	1
This battery is GREAT. On a full charge, this baby allows my Aspire One to run (uninterrupted) for nearly 12 hours, depending on what I'm doing. Will watch movies for 6 hours, surf the net and work on homework for 12+ hours. Very well made, no compatibility issues with my Aspire One, good to go out of the box!	0
I have purchased this product about two months ago and since then I'm using the spare batteries and I'm satisfied but still there is a problem as one battery gives the best backup and the other one is not good and gives the poor battery lifetime and that really disappoints.	1
I orderd noor more than 4 months ago. It's very good product. It works, my wife is so happy that she gets all the channels she is looking for . I got all the sports channels. also the company customer support is amazing	1
Playing ukulele is the way I could kill boredom during free time.<br />I bought this one few months ago.<br />Until now, the sound still has a great quality.<br />The physical state of ukulele is still the same since I bought it.<br />My ukulele case helped it to stay as it was before.	1
I absolutely love this product. Me and my wife were both overweight so we decided to change our life. We got a lot of changes in eating but it was hard to lose weight. So we decided to help a bit, and this product did excactly that!	1
Perfect pout of the box..... Had a few links taken out to size it properly. If you want a fine quality watch at a great price, this is the watch! The additional diamonds set it apart from others!	1
I was told that I would not need a bottle warmer when I registered.  This thing made those 11pm, 3am, 6am feelings much more doable.  Easy to use and does what it is suppose to!	0
Cheap and sounds good.  I was worried about the strings sitting on the frets because of other reviews on different acoustic bass guitars, but this one didn't have any problems.	0
I have not used it yet. From the add it sounds like it will do the job. I have to find the time to get up on the roof and apply it.	0
These umbrellas are adorable and a little different from your standard drink umbrellas.  The sticks are long enough to fit well pushed into a cupcake.  They were pretty hard to open, but we made them work.	0
This is a gift for my new grand-baby that isn't born yet.  I love love love this so much and I can't wait to see it on him or her.	0
This is a really nice small wireless keyboard. It is thin, and is a real space saver. A few keys are in a different location to make the smaller size possible. The wireless connection works perfectly, and the touch response of the keys is just right.	0
it make the rough road surface feel much more smooth, great grip, the rough road I skate before became remarkable smooth now, and quiet.	0
Great phone, works great and even sounds great over ip. Only flaw i seem to have is changing ring tone. It doesn't have many to chose from although its not really an issue. Also phone cord is short, but isn't something that cant be fixed.	0
I got it from local store, easy to fly, does not break on impact (dropped from 5m), great camera angle, I did change some stuff on it, like better battery (stock one is ok but I needed few hours to fly), you cannot miss with this product.	1
Wow! Sleeves are super, super short! Shirt was intended for the son wearing the suit...son who received the shirt is standing in the middle. He likes his sleeves rolled up or pushed up, at least it got one wearing. Obviously the suit has the same problem, but he insisted on keeping the suit!	0
I found it pretty entertaining and different from other chick flicks. Marital problems avoided and a perfect family in the end? Only in movies... Overall a nice way to spend evening with a glass of wine and discuss it later with real friends with kids	1
Not great but VERY good - good plot and action - good actors - Worth the $$ - Good enough to watch more than once!	0
This canister is perfect for a 12 to 16 ounce bag of ground coffee. I love the tinted color and look of the lid and shape. It's all plastic, but BPA free, and has a stainless "look" to the lid much like my Cuisinart coffee maker so it looks good on the counter. I love the push down knob/handle in the middle which makes it airtight. It forms an excellent seal and is super lightweight and compact. This beats leaving my coffee in the bag. I go through coffee very quickly and this keeps it very fresh. It would only be better if it were dishwasher safe and less of a struggle to put the rubber seal back on after handwashing it. (But my 13-year-old took over and it was a cinch for him to put the seal back.)  I definitely recommend the canister, which could be used for all kinds of items like pasta, candy, cereal, sugar, really anything. But it works perfectly for my coffee and is a much nicer solution to leaving the coffee in its original coffee bag sitting on the counter, which also results in me getting grounds on the counter when I pour from the bag. I'm impressed with the look, size, the pop top and how fresh it keeps my coffee. I like it so much I bought the little OXO pop container scoop for 2.99 and its fits perfectly in the container.[[ASIN:B00HEZ886W OXO Good Grips Pop Container Scoop]]	0
This is a funny movie, from beginning to end. These first class actors did a great job with the plot. I never seem to become bored with this, no matter how many times I watch it. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. It is a fine piece of work.	0
The kid's loved this piñata and it held up long enough to give them the thrill of clubbing a baby animal... just kidding...	0
This is a great product for home use, but I can't speak to professional use. I've seen big warehouse stores offer lesser quality karaoke machines for a similar price. Although those machines come with a mic and a built in monitor, this has better sound quality, the capability of playing multiple formats as well as playing music from a thumb drive. The only thing I would remind people thinking about buying this is that you have to purchase your  own mics, and hopefully you have a good sound system. (but this is true of most machines).	1
I looked on the internet for a long time for a good vanity for adults that wasn't too high in price.  Saw this one and with all the great reviews gave it a try.  Contacted the seller after about 4 days to see when they were going to send it out (noticed they hadn't yet.  I received it about 3 days later; earlier then expected.  It came with all the pieces and nothing broke or scratched!  Whoo-hoo, off to a good start!  I'm 5'7 and about 230 lbs.  The chair is very sturdy and I can fit my big rear in it just fine!  The size of the whole vanity is perfect!  I have plenty of room in my mirror to see my face (not too short).  The vanity seems to be well built and I had it put together in about 30-40 minutes all by myself.  The instructions aren't super great as they are just photo's showing what goes where but easy enough to figure it out.  You don't need any tools but I used a hammer to get the plugs in all the way for the mirror.  No big deal.  The shelving has more room then what I imagined.  I'm very happy with this purchase and highly recommend it!	0
Mostly true to size. Comfortable, durable and easy to walk in. These are my new travel favorites! Easy to take off and on at security and I can walk a lot in them without discomfort. I'm going to buy more styles.	1
This controller takes you back to your youth with simple plug and play compatibility.<br /><br />No drivers needed on any of my XP/Vista/7  Desktop or laptops.<br /><br />Control stick is not the same "narrow piece of grinding plastic shaft that wobbles as it wears" but a modern day digital replacement that feels like the original yet maintains the original appearance. It has a "dust n' snack"  shield under the main stick that stealthily defends the inner workings from any kind of  Funyun or Dorito crumb you can throw at it that misses your maw during the wild split second snack breaks classic games offer. There is no notable lag on a modern day Windows 7 system.<br /><br />I love it, and my 13 year old retro gaming crazed son loves it as a great Christmas addition to our retro gaming center that includes a pc media center addition.<br /><br />Don't be the Simpsons Jeff Albertson  and give this thing a negative rating for what it is for the money. If you can do better than by all means please do so.<br /><br />Make it perfect, tout it as such, and let me know where I can find it here on Amazon... Then let me critique it.<br /><br />I eagerly await your submission.	0
I purchased these towels based on the positive feedback I had read on Amazon, and ordered 3 sets.  I love the smaller size of these towels because they are easier to use.  One side has the silver threads in it for gentle scrubbing and the other is smooth.  They dry quickly after washing dishes.  I have already given a couple away to my sisters who were curious about them, and they are enjoying them as well!  I just wish they came in other colors besides BRIGHT green or orange.  They make hand washing fun again!  :)	0
The tattoos were distributed by Oriental Trading Company. They are not glittery at all. Very disappointing. Barely a shimmer. Would not recommend to purchase.	0
I love this bag and have purchased it 3 times before. It has many sections in which to organize your belongings. However, each time, the zipper wore out and separated before the leather wore out. I just wish they would make it with a metal zipper.	0
I've been using Kettlebells for ~ 15 years as part of my martial arts routine and know firsthand how useful these things can be for both men and women who want to strengthen and stabilize their core, burn fat, and build muscle. Sure, weights can do the same thing, but Kettlebells have certain advantages, not the least of which is that they're fun and easy to use. The kettlebell's center of mass is extended beyond the hand, hence utilizes more muscles than traditional dumbbells, meaning that a kettlebell workout is more effective and yields better results in less time too. What I hadn't found until now was useful instruction for those who have played around with them but want something more. Lorna Kleidman clearly knows her stuff, she is a 3-time Kettlebell World Champion, author, and coach, and it shows in the instruction. Ignoring the tutorial (~ 20 min) which you'll only need a couple of times, the DVD has a ~40 minute exercise routine, and ~ 4 minute cool down covering intermediate Kettlebell exercises. This makes for a well-produced, easy to follow, useful workout. You will need two Kettlebells for this routine (Lorna suggests ~ 10-15lb and 20-25lb for woman and ~ 15-20lb and 30-35lb for men) and a mat or towel, all of which are easily available at most any sporting goods store or online.	0
We purchased this as a simple solution for our outdoor TV. It focuses the sound forward so we don't need to crank the volume. It adds clarity to voices when watching TV. The quality of the sounds is not great but perfect for our purpose.	0
I needed a place to put things I always seem to tuck somewhere else and can never find later -- passport, SSN card, birth certificate, car titles. Nothing financial or valuable like money, jewelry or stocks, etc, I just need something I can grab or find if a fire ever happens. Also put some family pics and odds and ends in it.  This chest is definitely better than the drawers and tuckaway spots I had been using.  I don't need Fort Knox, and I don't store ammo in it like another reviewer, or plan to drop it off a table, like another reviewer did.  I just slide it under the bed and know that I'm better off with this than I was before I bought it.	0
Product is excellent, although comes with absolutely any instructions, I went to u-tube to get video instructions, my Yamaha G16 Cart did not have a windshield, so I was starting from scratch. The ordering instructions say that this windshield is for the factory frame, but did not give the measurements, somewhere in the blogs I read 40.5 wide, and 36.25 high, if your frame has these measurements, as mine did, it should fit perfect, and yes it is easy to install once you see the video, or easier yet if you are replacing a existing windshield already on the cart. Comes with 5 mounting brackets that just clip onto the frame, the 2 large pieces fit on the side of the frame, pay attention to the 3 smaller pieces that fit on the bottom of the frame, the curved part of the windshield when folded down will rest on these.	0
If you love history and Black History, this is a great video.  I have big respect for Angela Davis and have had the pleasure of meeting her before I graduated from Cal State. She is a true soldier for justice and this is a dynamic DVD...I highly recommend this.	0
Good chair to have around when you need an extra seat. We use ours when we have family/friends over. It's very comfortable and it also stores easily.	1
My sweet littel puppy &#34;Soni&#34; is a female dog. And I love her as my brand new TATA car. I bought her 11 month earlier. And I take a course how to pet your dog. They taught me many things about bog. So I am very careful about my Soni's health and beauty. I used many none and unknown product to clean up my Soni's ear. But they don't work out. Then I find &#34;Betta Bridges Pets Ear Cleaner&#34;. Now I am using it from 1 month. And it worked our. Thanks Betta Bridges.	1
I've had a lot of experience with screen protectors (I'm paranoid about scratches) and these are one of the better ones	1
This is a useless piece of junk and I'm glad I got it for free, otherwise it would have been money wasted. When I saw it, I could already tell that I wouldn't get any use out of it and I was right. When I held it, the plier felt incredibly flimsy and unreliable. You don't want this.	1
These are nice little printable notes. About the size of a post it note.  However, if you really wanted to use these to display specials and other quick snippets of info, it might actually be better to use a neon pot it note or an index card. As long as you (or an employee) has good legible hand writing (and maybe a little creative flair) then you can do more and look great with other alternatives.  You could always just print some images and then cut them out - this is basically what this is - it just has the tape pre applied.  So anyway - this is the basic choice:  if you want to have the quick and easy printable solution (for a price), then these are it. If you want a cheaper solution, then there are plenty of alternatives ....	0
Just enough space for a week's worth of clothes for vacation. I received what not what I ordered. The colors were WAY off... I was kind of disappointed. Not a happy camper over here.<br /><br />There is also an odd flap on the bottom side of the luggage that is not tacked down correctly. Makes me worry I'll lose some socks or small pieces of clothing back there. Other than that, the luggage is good. I'm very happy with the size of it, but that's about it.	1
This is a baby monitor only, If you try and use this for security you will be greatly disappointed. I have tried all settings, Locations and indoor and outdoor. Sensitivity is way to high turn them all the way down and they pick up the shadow of my flag waiving in front yard. If you like watching birds it will pick them up as they fly away lol. If you want to watch your baby this is perfect if you want to stay up all night. What a fail GE. Battery life less than 6 hours on the monitor part depending on alerts.	1
The cross is very solid. When I ordered it I was thinking it was going to be bigger, but I never wear any necklaces or chains, but I just liked the cross itself. I wore it with just a t-shirt and got a couple compliments my first day wearing it.<br /><br />The size measurements listed are pretty right on, so if you can wear something that is a little bit more bigger than traditional necklaces this will be good for you.	0
This is the best LED desk lamp i have ever used, this lamp is really unique and special compared to other forms of it found in the market. I love the fact that it is LED and the light is really bright and it last longer. The lamp has about 5 different mode that one can switch to, it really good for reading as the white light is really bright, it can also be adjusted for relaxation, bed time. The lamp has a USB pot and lot of other conditions around. Its LED so it does not really occupy space on my table, the touch pad control is also very lovely, as it responds to touch very fast. The lamp has a USB port that i use to charge any of my gadgets that is USB enabled. It can also be twisted to suit my style.<br />I strongly recommend this lamp for students,couples,families and friends.	1
This product is what it is. makes the truck unique and different. i would recommend this product to anyone looking and not looking.	0
I have read this author for a number of years and find all her books very entertaining.  I'm always excited to find a new book from her.	0
The mouse is very disappointing and keeps loosing signal and I have to turn it off and on a couple of times before it re-links and works again. I was really liking the mini keyboard and was keeping the whole product for just that, and after &#60; 60 days (but no longer able to return!) it totally failed. I won't buy this product or anything by this manufacturer again. Note: If i had purchased an item from Cost-Co, Best Buy, Walmart, etc., I would have had 90 days and been able to return it.   Buyer Beware...	0
I can't imagine not using these packing cubes. They make packing a suitcase much easier & you can fit a lot of rolled up clothes in them to save more space!	0
I bought this so my little one and I could finally have some french bread with her favorite meal which is spaghetti and meatballs. Since both of as are highly gluten intolerant and the store bought brands of gluten free french breads and baguettes are either a) inedible or b) really expensive, I decided to try my hand at making some myself. Gluten free dough sticks like nobody's business but this pan wouldn't know it! All I did was brush a little olive oil on before spooning the dough onto it and after it rises and bakes it came right off! Voila! Just like a little miracle, we have bread like everyone else :) Yay! Now if I can just get my GF pizza dough to do the same thing... hmmm, a pizza pan made the same way?? Are you listening SCI Scandicrafts?	0
This is definitely the most interesting book I have read this year. It exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be primarily be about "extremophiles" or organisms that live in extreme environments here on earth. However, it gave a great overview of the possibilities for life forms based on completely different chemistry (for example silicon based) with a lots of fascinating info on the potential for extraterrestrial lifeforms. Highly recommended!	1
I have an addiction...to highlighters--there, I said it! For years, I've dealt with over-saturated books, massacred by the previous pages I'd marked. But NO MORE! These highlighters leave a finish that almost looks like it is printed on the actual page. NO bleed through, and NO inability to read other pages.<br /><br />I'd also like to point out that for such a fine product, these highlighters are extremely affordable! Great product, and a must buy!	0
this is a quality product.it has a very good bright light and works and looks like the photograph.if you have a led headlight this light will also add  to that giving you also a light from the ground.and more road visiblity.i love it it makes my bike look good and also increases visibility for motorists and more road visibilty.i highy recomend this product.works very well	0
I could never get close to a clear picture on this device. I would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
Tells it like he saw it. And he has seen quite a bit. Must read for racers and those that think they are engineers.	0
Wow! I am so surprised to see the amazing width of this curb. This product is just a perfect for all guys like me who love wearing men's jewelry. I found this product online and cant resist buying this immediately.	1
This book is really well-written. Informative, clear, easy to understand. Need a better flow though.	1
The fan is just as it is, but im not satisfied with the airflow and the quality. seems like it will just last for few uses. :(<br />But anyway, it's not so expensive. I just get what I paid for, sadly.	1
Great quality. My father in law loves it and it's his favorite team! Smooth leather and small enough to fit in the pant back pocket.	0
Not sure what to make of this one. I would like to believe the author, but he just leaves such a bad taste in my mouth with the ego he has. Maybe being a Dr. this is just how he sees himself. I gave it 3 stars because I just do not know if it is true or not. I feel that maybe the author just needed a new way to make money but I can admit I could be wrong. Judge for yourself is my best advice.	1
This product is wonderful!  I look forward to using it every night!  It smells SO good and I fall asleep very quickly and I sleep through the night when using the Sweet Dreams spray!	1
This arrived earlier than I expected (by FedEx) the packaging was so well done that it took me about 6 mins just to get it undone! The item was perfect! Well made - pretty heavy duty! I would order this 10 more times if I needed them all!	0
This book is delivering some pertinent guidance in terms of dieting. However, for me, most of this guidance wasn't unknown. And some of the advises simply cannot be applied in all situations.	1
Awesome pack. No lags and freeze. I've been playing with this for over 6 months now. This 2k Sports Combo pack for Xbox is recommended!	1
A must have if you are a CoD fan. Great story and the multiplayer is amazing. I have not stopped playing it since I opened it.	0
I bought this for my son after looking at what is the safest seat for his age and weight and this one was one that was popular and I can see why. the seat is rally safe and nice feature and Is conformable for long rides.	0
The cartridges seem to be of high quality, but from the first printing they smudged considerably. I pulled them out to see if there was anything obviously wrong and I could see that the ink jet nozzle outlets were covered with a sturdy clear plastic cover. I tried to remove the covers buy they were firmly attached. The cartridges will probably work OK without the plastic but I have no way to remove it (short of total destruction of the nozzle).	0
Came exactly as described. I had no issues with each slot opened smoothly and did not need to &#34;cut&#34; opening as some other reviewers wrote.	0
all 3 lights were defective. at first i thought the battery in each was bad, upon further testing it appears each chip/bulb was defective I hope for a full refund.	0
I used this miso in an incredible vegan recipe. Was not familiar with miso paste prior to purchasing this.  Tasted by itself, it has a salty and pleasant, exotic flavor.  I added this to red lentils and sweet potatoes to make a vegan hummus.  Excellent.  I will use again. Further, I will continue to explore new dishes that call for miso paste.	0
A horribly good card, I personally haven't played it but I got it for my brother and it's been a minor nuisance ever since. Can indirectly turn any token deck into a milling deck and with a mana cost of only 1 it could really fit into any deck as a 'just cause' kinda card.	0
Quality is poor, not that great for what I paid. The chair is so light it moves when you sit and the cushions are extremely hard to sit on.	0
The perfect product for my stove top while cookin. I can keed my spoons right where I need them; and not mix them up. It's sturdy and a great buy.	0
I dont have any complaints. Bought it for the wife and she's happy with it. She has no complaints and so I have none. 5 stars	1
This Honeywell thermostat is a simple, easy to use, extremely sturdy little device that's far more elegant and streamlined than other thermostats. In addition, I asked my furnace guy to hook up all three wires so I could use 'on' as well as 'auto' for my air delivery, and the entire furnace became far more quiet than it had been with the Source 1 thermostat we were replacing. Few people, including two different furnace guys I've worked with, have the slightest idea that it takes 3 wires for a furnace to provide top functioning, but it does. However even if we'd hooked up the Source 1 with 3 wires it still required a huge amount of programming and was generally ridiculously arduous to set up. I couldn't be happier  with the Honeywell and I would recommend it unreservedly.	0
I've attended many traditional tea ceremonies, including ones in Japan. In the tea house I went to in Kyoto there was a tea class that explained how to properly prepare matcha. If you are looking for tea to create an authentic ceremony then I would highly recommend this tea. When I prepared this tea it brought me back to the tea house in Kyoto. I would prepare this tea for guests, exchange students, conducting a ceremony, and when teaching about Japanese culture.<br /><br />At Japanese tea ceremonies the most important thing is the green tea. Ceremonial tea grade matcha is the highest quality powdered green tea. When you open the container you can see and smell the quality. When I opened this package I could tell that the matcha was great quality. The smell wasn't bitter, but lightly sweet, and it smelled like grass. The power is fine, soft, and pure green. It did not stick to the package sides and slide easily out into the cup. The taste is a mixture of slightly bitter and similar to barley. It also has a unique flavor itself that I can only describe as matcha itself.<br /><br />When you make green tea from powder you need to consider how to make it properly. A cup that is shaped like a bowl is appropriate for traditional ceremonies, and you would need a bamboo whisk to stir the powder and water. It should froth at the top while you whisk, and after you whisk. If you like stronger tea then the entire pouch is good for one cup, but if you don't like strong tea then only use half of it. The water shouldn't be boiling hot, but just before the boiling point. If it is too hot it will take away from the flavor, and if it is too cold it will be extremely bitter and clump together. If you're just drinking this in a regular mug you should be cautious with how strong you are making the matcha, and stir it with a regular utensil. Make sure to stir thoroughly so that you don't leave any clumps in the cup.<br /><br />When drinking this tea you should finish it in one sitting. If you let the tea become cold it will increase in bitterness and become unpleasant. It is rude to not finish a cup of tea during a traditional ceremony, and the last sip should be a long one. If you haven't attended a ceremony but want to prepare one I suggest watching a video first because there are many steps to making the perfect cup of tea. The cup, whisk, scooper, kettle, and tea can make the difference in preparation for a ceremony. With this tea it is important to have the other components be top quality to enjoy the tea at its best.<br /><br />This grade of tea doesn't need anything added but water. You shouldn't add sugar to this tea, or lemon, or anything else. If you think it is too bitter then you should eat sweets while drinking it. Youkan is the traditional Japanese bean paste sweet to have with matcha. The sweets will curve the bitterness and make the experience more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are wanting to make green tea ice cream I suggest staying with this brand, but consider using a lower grade of tea. It still works with ceremonial grade, but it seems like a waste to use such high quality tea for something else. Adding some powder on top of vanilla ice cream tastes amazing. There are more uses for green tea than just drinking it, though with this grade of green tea the best way is to drink it.	0
The supplements worked as described and I've had others provide less acceptable results for a lot more in price. This product excels the competitors, and it's at the best price and the shipping was also very good.	1
I honestly can't say enough about this wallet.  Perfect size for my passport and the ID's I use to travel with.  It has already been half way around the globe and back with me and I still love it.  It has taken me a lot of ugly ducklings to find the perfect one and now I have.  Fits perfectly in both my sport coat inner pocket or my back pocket and looks great.  If you are a frequent traveler who wants something to keep everything in one place without having a really long brief, this is for you!!!	0
This is very much amazing book which can gives you the pleasure to know the technique. The 5 minute plantar facilities solution is the great book of all this things. Highly recommend for you.	1
My mother loves It's a Wonderful Life and so I had to give her this as a present. She loves it and watches it whenever we come over. I'm not a fan, but I tolerate it anyway.	1
What an awesome price for a 16 in 1 lego...I bought this set for my 7 year old son and he absolutely fell in love with the idea of a lego with lasers. I enjoy building the 16 space fighters set with him (thanks to the simple and easy instructions which came with it) and it’s a great fun. Also he creates some of his own using his imagination, so now me and my son are constantly building new things. He just doesn’t seem to get tired of it. I’m really impressed by Laser Pegs as they are giving such an amazing lego building set in such an amazing price. I would surely recommend this to all the dads out there looking for a quality fun with your kids.	1
I set this off to make sure things were functioning correctly. Wow! The siren is so loud. It will defianately catch the attention of any intruder and the people in the surrounding area. It will be pretty tough for someone to continue the intrusion after this siren goes off. This is a great option for the person who would like to monitor the system on thier own.	1
I wanted something to wear on my surprise date with my husband that would grab his attention. This dress fit loosely but not too loose. I love how it exposed my back just enough to see my shoulder blades. And is just the perfect length to let his imagination wander. He loves this dress on me and now every time we go out he is like you’re going to wear that hot little dress that comes to mid-thigh and shows me your back. The quality of the dress is also amazing it is tightly and strongly stitched and care is easy if you follow the directions on the tag, It doesn’t lose its form or shape.	1
The workmanship of this razor guard is much better than the one that originally came with the shaver. This one is stronger, and denser. The original was much more flimsy and sheer. This is a difficult product to find in stores and it was slightly less expensive here on Amazon so it was a win-win purchase! Of course this replacement comes with both the new cutting head and the shaving guard.	0
It's too bad we can't buy this item at the store. Its sturdy construction and double canopy make it ideal for my city walks. It's compact design makes it easy to carry. This was exactly what I hoped to find.	1
I have no idea how it happened. I just took it out of my pocket and there are two large cracks on my glass protector. Disappointed and wouldn't recommend.	1

I was looking specifically for a wallet that holds lots of cards, because I carry so many.  This one is perfect for that.  The one negative comment I have is that it's hard to get money into the pocket, and there is no place for change, but I rarely carry cash, so it's not a big deal.	0
We had a doorbell installed before where the sound it made drove me nuts every time. It was loud and screechy. This product however, is sweet and doesn't make me jump every time someone was at the door which is fairly often.	1
No doubt this is the best one product i have used for my dog . I also tried many for my dog Immune system but all was useless and finally this one work for my dog and i got a good result only in few days. I am very happy with my purchase and will buy it again when i need.	1
I have been a fan of tarot cards for many years and this book helped me learn even more about reading the cards.	1
I so love this item. This can be worn in any way you want it to be. It was very soft, comfortable and super cute. I can pair it with any outfit I want it to be. Great product!	1
Did a great job.It de-limed my coffee maker and got it working like new again.Had tried the vinegar and several other cleaners,none of them did a satisfactory job.	0
Love the image quality of this camera. I captured great moments using this camera. Good for special occasions.	1
What can I say? They didn't take much breaking in at all - no blisters. The back zipper is sturdy and no problem getting them on and off. We haven't had much of a mud season, but they seem to be holding up well to her stomping around in the yard. They look great, too.	1
I am a long distance rider and really hate having to fill the extra space in my hydration pack with tools and various items. I extremely recommend the "large" when purchasing this item. For the price it is unbeatable and you will have a lot of extra space. The bottom unzips to add an extra few inches of bottom space or you can leave it zipped. This bag is durable and really stays with your bike (even during crashes...I recently found out). Great purchase, great price, great deal.	0
The strap doesn't create any pressure points while sleeping, the material is soft and blocks out all light on my head shape, the raised eye covers are great and even with my long eyelashes i can't feel it at all when I blink!	1
I absolutely love this show! I was bored one day so I decided to look on amazon for tv shows to buy & I came across this one. I read about it & it sounded like something I would really enjoy watching so I took a chance. I don't have cable/satellite so I can't watch it when it airs on tv. After watching the first season I was hooked! So I bought another season & I can't wait to buy the 3rd season when it comes out! I can't wait to see what happens! I hope this show lasts for many more seasons because it is one of my favorites.	0
Rubber cover on thumb stick easily fell off. Electronics work ok, but is not useful when the suit rubber pad falls off.	0
One use and that was it....Hugely disappointed in this item.  We pumped up the ball connected to our pole and the next time we checked to use it all air was gone.  Don't know if it was a function of the hot AZ summer climate, but, the prior Lifetime ball that came with our original kit lasted several years.  The Lifetime ball is 4 times the price of this ball, however, perhaps it is a matter of getting what you pay for.	0
When I use a product, I don't want to settle with what is just good. It has to be mind-blowingly excellent. So far, this product has only been good.	1
This is a very nice little knife which I use to open boxes with. I open a lot of boxes during my day at work and this knife slices right though the shipping tape like it wasn't there. Of course I could use a utility knife, like my coworkers do and like I used to before I got this, but this is so much better. Plus I carry this in my purse. You never know when you're going to have to open something.	1
I was excited about this bag but disappointed when it showed up. The button was broken and there were no pieces of wood in the box or packing materials, so this says to me they actually made this bag with a broken jagged edged button.	1
I purchased these nice white wall plates to replace the dull and aged looking plates in use in my house.<br /><br />This was correctly sized to fit standard switches and I was able to install several different brands of switches without any issues in fit or finish.	0
Cute wallet with great storage compartments. Unfortunately it was much bigger than I expected, since I carry a fairly small cross body purse. Zipper broke within a year.	0
This is a great watch for the price. Quality was above my expectations and I'm getting tons of compliments from everyone.	1
I have used this product for years with great success in all of my family's European cars, my motorcycle, and my lawn and outdoor equipment. They have it for the best price but are often not in stock in my area.	1
[[VIDEOID:mo2BXV12LCI0AMF]]I got this bag to use as a groceries shopping bag but decided it was too pretty for groceries.  It is made out of a polyester tapestry, the type you might see in wall textile wall hangings. It is very nice looking.  Its size is 15.75" x 12.75" with a 27" handle made out of black strapping.  I use it for carrying books and non-grocery shopping.<br /><br />This tote bag is provided by Banberry Designs.<br /><br />Ali Julia review	0
I do have to say this is one vitamin I take and can feel the difference. I have tried many, and this does have the right combination of vitamins that work for me as told by my nutritionist. Will keep using as long as they work.	1
I will find a use for these, but I was expecting these shop ticket holders to be made of a thicker material.	0
A nice clean looking fan that works great on a lower ceiling. I am using this fan on an outside porch. I wanted a fan that was clean looking, weather resistant and easy to clean. The integrated 100 watt light works great and can be dimmed to the user's requirements.	1
Used it for 3 passports and this is perfect for travelling. The name and quality speak for themselves. Its sturdy, and elegant. The quality is great.	0
I love the smooth glass finish on this screen protector. Easy to apply. Here's it's specialty though: I fell while carrying my phone and used the hand holding the phone to stop my fall and the phone took the main impact.<br />I picked my phone up expecting the worst and low and behold the screen saver is the only thing that took a hit. Not one scratch reached the main phone screen. I was very impressed.	1
Tweaked my back after birth and side-lying nursing. Totally helped with the ache. Was able to go about my day, without excruciating pain	0
Xbox's are great! They do just about everything a PS3 does except play bluerays. I've only had great experiences with an xbox, while I have had several friends experience the red ring of death, I have no complaints. I've heard the best way to prevent that is to keep your system breathing well and well dusted.	1
This product is very well made. The satin is beautifully smooth and it's a cute design. The minky is super soft. I think the quality is better than our older son's name brand tag blanket. I am really pleased with this lovey!	0
This was not the product I was expecting or advertised here. The colors are off, quality is very low and size is tight so it won't fit an average 5'8 person. Stay away from this counterfeit crap made in Hong Kong.	1
I was really excited to get these pearls. They were very pretty, and a great size.. not too big, not too small. However, after I started wearing them for a few days the silver paint that covers the stud came off inside of my piercing hole. I tried to get it all out..but it was quite difficult. Afterwards, it looked safe to wear them since the icky paint came off, but that was a big mistake. My ears turned green..just like when you buy a cheap ring. Its more disturbing when the green is inside your ear though. Sad.<br /><br />Basically..if you need these for a one-time event, they're good. Don't wear them more than once.	0
Band fits and is leather but not as pictured.  Pictures shows a smooth band and it's actually marble textured	0
good price for these cahrms, I like them a lot.. but they're not pandora so just make sure you realize this before buying it! otherwise really like it it makes my pandora bracelet look more full without spending a ton on it.	1
reaches the entire distance without extensions I need another one since my lawnmower really liked the old one	0
I did not buy this product from Amazon, but I have used it several times and it always works flawlessly. It may look cheap but it seems to be well made. It is worth the money.	0
I ordered this hat for my husband. It is a lovely, well-made hat. The reason for the lower overall rating is that the size is misrepresented. Although it is advertised as a Medium and packing slip states that it is a medium, I'm assuming by the large tag lettered S inside the hat as well as the hat's dimensions that it is not a medium, but a small.	1
Great product.  Bought it to put together a few IKEA items i bought along with the 33 piece screw driver set from black and decker (highly recommended as this piece comes only with two bits)  and i could not be more pleased with my choices	0
I bought this  as a way to get myself to exercise. I am thin and healthy but I HATE working out. This turned out to be much more difficult than I expected. I had hoped that there would be several components that would be easy for anyone and that I could work my way up to the more challenging parts. Well even the so-called warm up just about killed me. I fell like I am too old (61) for this and will never be able to keep up with the intense pace of Zumba. I guess I should have bought a Richard Simmons Sweatin to the Oldies DVD instead. LOL Buy this if you are already pretty fit to add to your arsenal of workouts. If you are old and out of shape, this is too hard for you.	0
I'm not thin but I'm not morbidity obese. I bought these to replace carpet casters. They look slightly flimsy when I opened the bag but thought nothing of it. After getting all five casters on my chair one broke. Then the other four when. Ended up getting a set that cost ten times as much. One of those weighted as much as the five of these did total.	1
We have a bunch of these at home. Trying out different brands and such. This is far from the best but its decent enough.	1
I was warned that these only work on about 50% of the dogs that get them. It doesn't seem to help my pooch. He loves the flavor.	0
LOVE the fact they are rechargeable, over time those watch batteries add up $ wise. Works great with my 2013 Samsung PN51F5500, same quality you would find for double or triple the price in stores, a sure bargain.	1
Haven't gotten one YET but I&#34;m gonna -- Just FYI, this is a tiny little replica of a British golden age guitar amplifier, called the Watkins<br />Dominator. It was tubes, 15-20W and had two 12&#34; speakers, one behind each baffle. This is a very cool replica of that classic amplifier!<br />Danelectro never made one like this, but well, OK.	0
Really excellent product with pouch to hold your cards at one place, protect the phone as well.<br />Quality: 4.9/5<br />Packaging: 5/5	1
very bright as described and the package arrived even before time. mounted them on the pole of backyard and helped me a lot.	1
Not sure what the difference is between this and the regular עלית but I can't taste it if there is. Glad I found this product.	0
This fun product is watery but also feels dry at the same time. This is a positive that makes cleanup easy. It does its job and is extremely smooth and natural smelling.	1
These were OK, but nothing I would order again. In fact, I reordered a different pair for my son as I would not give him these, they smelled terrible; musty. The wrists were very open so they didn't provide any warmth factor.	1
This shade works well in my minivan. It's easy to get in and out, and keeps the car from getting too hot even when it's scorching outside.	1
This is a really cool lamp. The Shoe is hard plastic. The leg is plastic with a real net stocking. The shade is double lined cloth with wire support. The lamp switch is a 3 way, off, shade light on, leg light on, and both shade and leg on. Bought this for as a Christmas decoration but I intend to leave up year round just because it looks so cool.	0
I waited a while before I purchased this because of all of the negative reviews about lag and bugs.  I played Rogue first, and then Force Unleashed, I found this on Amazon for $30 near the end of December and assumed most of the glitches were fixed by then.<br /><br />I am about 68% of the way through the game and it is awesome!  The multi-player missions give excellent rewards and the que is never long on the playstation network.  There is a ton of missions all over the map and the companion app adds to the experience.  The battle system takes some getting use to, but after you've played for a while you'll be able to take on 3-4 guys at a time, as long as there aren't any snipers around :P<br /><br />If you are a fan of the whole assassin's creed franchise, you will enjoy this game.  If you came in late, say around ac 3 or 4?  It may not be as fun for you due to the lack of crazy naval battles and a throwback to the ground level exploration of ac1 through ac revalations.	1
I was skeptical, but felt that I needed to try something on my beard, when unconditioned is so coarse it can scrape paint or injure bystanders unlucky enough to brush against it. I am Scottish/Japanese/Sicilian, it's like wire growing out of my face.<br />After the first use out of the shower, I could already feel a difference. After using it for a week, I'm convinced that it not only works, but that I will continue to use it. I also started combing my beard with a Kent handmade comb, and it really helps get the oil worked in quickly without a bunch of rubbing. The oil is also great for my skin, I rub it all over my face after I put it on my beard.<br />Huge difference in texture and comfort. Love it.<br />Bonus:<br />My girlfriend loves the way my beard feels, and is always touching it now. Although sometimes she pets it, which is a little weird.<br />My kids like it too, which makes me happy.	0
What an excellent product!! This serum vitamin C is fantastic! My skin is more radiant and youthful since using. I use other products in this skin care line as well and every one is great! I wouldn't use any other skin care line. My skin is now in the best shape. I highly recommend this Serum	1
Bought it for my boyfriends Suzuki GSX-R-600. After looking around for prices, Amazon was the cheapest! The sound isnt too loud.	0
This case is the best. Fits perfectly for the new Ipad Mini and is rugged enough so that you are not afraid of damaging your new purchase. There are some cases that are cheaper but I would suggest going with the Otter Box. They are definitely superior to their competitors.	0
just to be fair, i really believe that this is a great slicer , and the idea was there, but unfortunately there are tricks when using this spiral slicer, i mean manual or something would have been helpful.<br /><br />I'm not saying something negative about this slicer because it does work, but however it did it took me almost a week in trying to learn how to use this slicer in cutting different kinds of vegetable.<br />the price i may say is fair, but i do wish that there were manuals in every box in showing us how to use this slicer properly.	1
These things are awesome. Watched the 3rd Transformers movie with them and it was just amazing. I can't explain how cool it is to watch 3d with these glasses.	0
doesn't have any scent and mixes well with my dior!  definitely love the extra confidence it gives me and guys totally have been giving me a second look lately when I go out.  It's so much easier to attract attention.	1
Love it! great fit for my phone and it is so comfy to handle<br />It doesn't seem to slide down<br />Great Product!	1
Yeah, why not if you want quality sunglasses that will last you a lifetime if you take great care of them. You definitely feel the difference between $15 sunglasses and $100 sunglasses.	1
This is a simple but effective garage door alarm.  First thing to drive a person crazy would be the false alarms, that are caused by the dying battery that was sent with it.  Change the battery, and all is well!  Has to be mounted really close to bottom of door, because the bottom door gasket keeps the door off the floor some distance already.  Distance wise, my furthest door is about 45-50 feet away; works fine and happy. Detached garage.	0
Love the Jazz III's I prefer the Max Grips but these are just as good and a good option if you don't like the feel of heavy grip picks.	0
I had a hard time finding this particular size in regular stores. The batteries seem to last pretty long. It's a battery, so obviously not terribly exciting, but the price I got was excellent.	0
I returned this grill. It had sharp edges which may injure the owner. Also the grates were not removable, so it would be very difficult to clean them. We were quite disappointed with the grill. It didn't put out enough heat to cook a steak. I guess you got what you paid for in this case..	1
If you are looking for a weak attempt of replicating the battlefield of the Siege of Khe Sanh then you have no need to get this book. Instead this novel provides a more vivid captivating and intense depiction of the historical event, a wonderfully written book with exciting screens that will grab the attention of any reader. Hats off to the Author for bringing this book to us.	1
Very attractive.  A bit larger than expected, but it looks good and I will find out soon if it does what it's supposed to do.  I like the look of it; and that's half the battle.	0
The display is large enough to read from across the room, even in daylight. So far it is very accurate and is happy it has a built in battery for backup, as we sometimes get momentary power hits.	1
I received the free samples form the seller! Thank you! ! They are super comfortable high heels ! I love this zebra print! I will buy all the colors because they're all pretty.  I been wear it all day long and it never hurts. Great news for the high heels lover! This pair is one of my favorite now! Fast shipping, and I am very impressed by the quality, detailed and lovely design. And it fit me perfect! I saw some buyer said that it run a bit small but if you can walk on it for a while it will fit you the way you want! The price is also lovely. Definitely add to my favorite store!	1
As good as advertised if not better. The shirt stays don't come undone no matter what you do. No damage at all to shirts. Really impressed with how these are constructed from all aspects. Very good metal but not too heavy so they are comfy and light. You can tell when you squeeze them how strong they are and that they're going to hold up without breaking. The nylon covers on the insides keep hold of the shirt and don't leave marks. The elastic is soft and doesn't yank on my leg hair. That's a problem I thought I'd always have with shirt stays, but these ones don't do it at all. Big improvement over what I was using before. Even easy to get on despite how hard they grip. Whoever designed these did a really good job. They thought of everything.	1
I have tried many serum that claim to repair your hair. This product has actually improved my color treated hair. I will buy this again when I run out. It does not leave your greasy. It is weightless on fine hair	0
Purchased this for my Jeet Kune Do training as my sparring has gotten more and more intense. Definitely built for more intense sparring as it does hinder movement a bit. So far so good.	0
After cleaning, washing and everything in between, the days can get incredibly long and boring. Killing a few hours with this has been quite refreshing for me.	1
I was so excited when I first set up my fountain.  As long as the sun was out and not covered with clouds it was beautiful.  Unfortunately I have only had for a little over a month and it no longer works :(	0
I'm wearing these right now. They are perfect for commuting to work in a dress. I hate pants and these help me get through the winter.	0
not bad at all for 300watt speakers that are this cheap to buy. perfect size, made a good fit and puts out plenny volume for out in the water. they've been splashed and still have no issues with the speaker or the wiring connections at all.	1
This is an unfortunate product. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who needs something more durable. This is good for light work at best.	1
One of my favorite movies at the time, this movie is pretty underrated. So many people haven't seen it... Featuring action, violence, a lovely friendship story, and a standout performance from a young Natalie Portman.	1
I was just on  the Internet a few weeks ago and heard complaints about these chinese water ionizers.  These are the Aqua Ionizer by Air, Water and Life that are supposed to be made in the USA but are really made in China.  I bought my unit about 8 months ago and we used it for a while but really didn't notice any difference in our health.  We are active people in our late 40's and we are always looking for ways to make us healthy.  We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them.	1
Very happy with purchase. The hardware kit came as described, easy to install and works great! I am considering purchasing another sail soon and will like repurchase the same kit. I recommend it for its quality, value and for its ease of operation.	1
These have been my go to shoes for Mud Runs (aka Obstacle Course Races) for the past 2 years as I'm still using the same pair and I probably do about 10-12 OCR's a year. These shoes are liking having 4WD for your feet when ascending and descending, steep, slippery, muddy slopes which is exactly what they've been bred for. I like them better than my Salomon SpeedCross 3's for OCR's because of the Fellraisers lower drop and more stable base. For regular trail races, I prefer my SpeedCross 3's. I can't recommend these enough if you are planning to use them for Mud Runs. If you're just looking to run gravel and relatively smooth, non-tehcnical trails, you may want to look at a shoe that may provide a bit more comfort as the ultra aggressive lugs on the Fell Raiser don't necessarily lend the shoe to the softest of feels, but they are still adequately cushioned.	0
This product really worked and was surprisingly easy to use. After researching online, I discovered that MMD's method for testing was identical to the experts.. I was quoted about 5 times as much to have someone come to my house and conduct the same testing. The report I got back from My Mold Detective was very easy to understand, too. I sent off the samples to the lab and waited three days to get results which was shorter than the local IEP's turn around time that I was quoted... I guess a week or ten days is the norm... But, sending off the samples was explained on the packaging and I double checked on the website. I rate this product 4.5 stars	1
I needed a simple phone to go on the wall where an old wall phone was removed. This looked OK out of the box at first sight. Then, even at Amazon's cheap price, phone not worth the money. Very cheaply made. When hung on wall the receiver falls off the hook. Best thing about this purchase was AMAZON! I contacted them and they refunded my money immediately and told me to dispose of the phone. It was so nice not have to go through the hassle of a return. THANKS AMAZON!	0
I love this product as compared to others I've tried, but have to say that the scent is really disgusting. I have to keep them in a ziplock bag at all times or they make my entire house stink. Must be sure to get unscented next time!	0
I just got this case from a local store, love it. Inside its made of rubber and seems to protect the vita pretty well. The games fit nicely and it does not interfere with the vita being on top of them. I also like that you can customize the images and I like other did NOT get the uncharted image. But I have already printed some out so I am good. I do recommend this case to those looking to store your vita.	0
The ingredients are simply MCT Oil and Palm Kernel Oil.<br /><br />In fact, Palm Kerney Oil is cheap cooking oil (Kernel of the coconut).<br /><br />You can get 100% MCT Oil on Amazon for 50% off this inflated marketing cost.	1
I was surprised that my package did arrived and I did not take  long that I tried using this item the moment I got it, and I was slicing ribbon like potatoes and pears, it was just amazing. I even let my husband and kids try using this slicer.<br />It was so easy to use this tri-blade slicer and we had so much fun and using it.	1
I didn't realize this knife was made in China. I would Have spent more and got one made in golden Colorado. Still ok for the price paid.	0
Since I love baking so I buy this Orblue  Pastry Cutter.i used to buy dough at Walmart or publix but I discovered making dough for pie is easy.Making more easy if you have like this cutter.I like this cos so easy to wash after I used.And the handle I can tell this product is high quality looks like not easy to break,I check like this at Walmart the prize is more than high $12 something and the quality is a big different.	1
My favorite pendants are crosses. This is also one of my most favorite.Anyway I also found another awesome cross lately. It is awesome and called [[ASIN:B00H7JADOA Hued CZ Gem Yellow Stainless Steel Cross Pendant with Triple Chain 13"]]. Both items are high quality and durable too.	1
Fortunate i got this mask the quality is soft & can hardly realise it on my eyes its a perfect light weight mask. I slept so nicely like a baby, whole day went energetic & refreshing Love this eye mask. Great for travel .Thank you 40 winks !	1
I use mine to host a MySQL database and it does great! These are so much better than the first versions...If you love your original Raspberry you'll love this one even more, it's a worthwhile upgrade.	1
Wonderful colors! These look great around my house during partys and expesially on the 4th of july! They fit well with just about every setting, and really have a great design. They have great size/sizes and can fit and work with a lot of places!	1
it arrived quickly and  was packed well. quality is fine with reasonable price. but, it is too lightweight and the stands could easily be swayed by strong wind.	1
I'm almost speechless this product is so good ... wow. Extremely heavy duty, not hard to install at all(*), works like a champ! I purchased two pairs of these, ran them 49&#34; wide (inside-to-inside) so I could fit a piece of 4' wide plywood on them, spaced them every other joist or 32&#34; o.c., so spanned a total of 96&#34;, and sure enough, my 8' plywood fit with only breath to spare, but it fit. I will never, I mean never load these things near to their limit, what with the little bit of scrap lumber, plywood, etc I'll put on them. I mean seriously, I was shocked at just how heavy duty these things are, way more than what it looked like in the pics.<br /><br />(*) Though it has zero to do with the quality or design of these brackets at all, I just have to share that dang, I had a devil of a time finding my joists perfectly, and I consider myself pretty good at that generally. Hopefully you'll have better luck than me but, at least be prepared ... I got so-o frustrated. The biggest issue I had was being on an 8' ladder and reaching to that 12' ceiling of mine, the max reach for that height ladder. Made me dizzy as all get out, which certainly didn't help as I kept thinking I had the joist from my finder, only to poke a small test hole with my drill to find air behind my spot ... whew, long, laborious work. I'm sure it would have been less stressful had I been working with shorter ceiling height.<br /><br />Oh yeah, while I could give you a ton of tiny tips, I'll give you this one - don't use a pencil to mark where to drill your pilot holes, but instead use a small-medium point magic marker. I learned that trick over half way thru and was ticked I hadn't thought of it sooner, for it is very difficult to hold that rod to the ceiling and keep it perfectly still while you mark thru the holes, and swirling that pencil around to mark the spots just begged for that thing to jump all over the place, whereas the marker made a quick dot and was done, and better to boot.<br /><br />Along those lines, another tip is, mark only the two holes closest to the vertical pole, take it down and drill those two holes, mount the bracket with those two, then drill the two remaining pilot holes with it attached, finishing by putting the last two screws in those holes. This works great for not only is marking all 4 holes before mounting just asking for 1 to 2 of them to be off and causing you great difficulty, if you do the outside 2 first like I did at first, you'll next find that drilling the closer-in pilot holes after the pole is installed (with first only the outside two screws) is next to impossible for the drill is just too fat to get that close to the pole on those last two. Trust me, you're probably having a tough time visualizing that right now but once you get into it, you'll say to yourself, &#34;oh, so that's what he was talking about.&#34;<br /><br />Good luck, hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine - yea!!	0
I had movie night for my sons 9th birthday and it was a big hit. The kids really enjoyed it. The projector worked great and got the job done. I paired it with a 12ft blow up movie screen and it worked perfect.	0
We have a one-year-old cat and an eight-month-old kitten. They both get so excited when they see it. They love to reach in and push the mouse so it runs around and watch it. It is a great way to keep playful cats entertained!	0
I purchased this lens for my wife as a Christmas present on Nov.16,2012 and after she opened it I decided to register the lens for the extended 4 yr. warranty which was included. I am dismayed and shocked that the paper work explicitly states several times that the warranty is invalid if the product is not registered within 10 days of purchase. This seems like some sort of scam that Nikon is using to weasel out of honoring the offered warranty. It remains to be seen if Nikon will stand behind this offer or not but I am very unhappy that the registration period is so short. So be warned, if the extended warranty is important to you, make sure you register as soon as you receive the lens.<br /><br />UPDATE--to Nikon's credit, I received a prompt reply to my email questioning whether they would honor the extended warranty--message follows--<br /><br />"Thank you for contacting Nikon. I do apologize for any inconvenience. Our Nikkor lenses comes with an additional 4 year warranty. In order to receive the additional 4 year warranty, you must register the lens as well as maintain the proof of purchase if any issues occur with the lens. Since it was a gift, if any issues occur and you need to send your camera to our service center, we recommend you state that in a brief description."<br /><br />no mention of the 10 day requirement here so why put it in the official paperwork?  I guess we will see in a few years.<br /><br />Later update---ended up returning this lens anyway--my wife was not happy with it's performance and I was not happy with Nikon's wishy washy reply to my complaint.	0
This TV displays some great pictures, so I have no complaints. I really don't care about much of anything that it offers really. As long as I can watch great shows with great quality, I'll be fine.	1
player is great for listening to old records.  sounds incredible for price, easy to use and very compact. just remember to stay near when close to finishing record. does not auto stop	0
It is not safe for my dog. The squeels away from the fence make me think something is happening that shouldn't	1
I've had some difficulty getting earphones that feel comfortable because I am not a large woman.  These so not press down on my ears painfully, yet they are sturdy and feel solid and well made, not flimsy at all.  As far as what they are made for, the sound is top notch for what I use them for, which is connecting them to my computer to listen to audio when viewing films.  I'm not saying they wouldn't be great for other audio purposes, just that I do not know.	0
My first impression of the toy was that I was not expecting it to be quite so large. The pictures don't do it justice!. Inside, it's packed to the brim with shredded paper, wood, and other fun toys. Actually, it was TOO packed and I couldn't keep it closed, so I removed half for future use.<br /><br />Overall, the only complaint is that the clip used to attach to the cage is not as strong as it could be. It is the circular screw variety that slips between bars. I've had other foraging toys that use a similar clip, but this one "skips" teeth if it is tightened too much causing it to actually get more loose. The problem is, the pressure to cause this is barely enough to keep it affixed to the cage, so now my small Timneh Grey can actuall rotate the toy. I think it needs to be made from less flexible plastic.	0
I don't see what the fuss is about, these notebooks are great! If it's the price, I'd rather pay for it rather than run all over the place to buy from whichever seller since I don't have the time. The convenience is worth it to be honest and the notebooks are perfect for what they are used for.	1
Tried this out prior to Alaska cruise and excursions. Glad I did. Clear plastic makes touch controls a little iffy. I think working with it and using it some will get me accustomed to the pressure needed to be able to affect touch control activations. May help in making the clear plastic a bit more pliable, which might help the cause, too.<br />Put iPhone in upside down (home button toward the top) so that when using the phone, it's oriented correctly.  This also ensures that the camera lens is not obstructed.	0
This knife feels really solid! I am really happy I came across at this price because I feel it should be listed for more. The spring makes the blade shoot right out unlike other spring “assisted” knifes where your finger has to do most of the work. The digital cammo gives this knife a very masculine look and that's one of the reasons why I bought it. The handle is great and feels very comfortable. This was definitely made to last using high quality parts. I have cut everything from metal wires to rubber and plastic and the blade still works great. Definitely would recommend!	1
Over the years we remodeled a few homes and we have bought many electric wall heaters, and we final stuck with this Stelpro. We like the metal cover over others that we have seen and used. The cover has a smooth rounded look to it, we standing over it you can’t see the internal parts like the fan. Some times with mount it vertically or horizontally all depending on what is above the heater. Because it’s so compact we are able to install in just about anywhere. Its shipped by UPS and we got it that same week double boxed.	1
These arrived quickly and fit our ceiling vents perfectly.  The price was much better than that of the local big box store.  We replaced all of our vents this spring as we painted throughout the house.  I figured out that the number of louvers is consistently the same regardless of size.  The 14&#34; grill has 12 louvers.  The 12&#34; has 10 louvers.  The 10&#34; has 8 louvers, etc.  This made it much easier to determine which size I needed for each room without pulling out the ladder to measure each one.  Hope this helps.	0
I am so happy to have found this product! My hair and nails both are beginning to finally grow after years of trying.I am so glad to have finally found a product that gives me results .	1
I bought this blanket 13 years ago. I still have it. It is one of those quality items that you never get tired of or give away. This is a unique item and I'm thinking of ordering another one for myself for Christmas and for gifts for friends. The quality is great, 13 years later it still shines!	0
I like this pencil sharpener.  I don't sharpen a lot of pencils so I had a battery operated sharpener but every time I wanted to use it I had to change the batteries!  So far this sharpener is working out well.  Sharpens to a nice point.	0
I think the watch is really pretty and looks so beautiful and gold. Um, only thing that disappointed me about this watch is it did not come in a box! :( lol It was wrapped in bubble wrap. I wanted it to come in a box because I was buying it as a gift for my aunt and everyone knows I can't give her a watch without a box! It will look used. :) Anyways.. I talked with the sellers about that concern I had and they were very understanding and dealt with me very patiently, prompt and professional. So, "Lovers2009" are indeed excellent sellers to deal with when you have concerns.<br /><br />This all being said, the watch does NOT look cheap in anyway and is so worth the 6 bucks, it is such a steal for the look. I received it ticking and in great condition. Oh and one last thing worth mentioning if I were to use it, it did not fit on my wrist. Keep in mind your wrist size, I would say this is for women with big wrists. Sorry girls, unless you want to scoot the watch up like on your arm to let it fit. I hope my review is helpful. Thanks! If you want to see a personal photo I took of the watch please e-mail me at Hebakadadah33@gmail.com. It won't let me post pictures on this review! Thanks!	1
The jars arrived on time and the size and shape are exactly what I wanted for storing spices. These are adorable. I am looking forward to using them to make various home made things like tofu mayonnaise and fat free red vinaigrette salad dressing. I think I am going to order more as I now want to pickle ginger and garlic these jars will be perfect for that purpose. It is a great product.	1
I received this great little thermometer as a gift. And am really happy with it, it's very easy to use and gives fast, precise results. I love how it has a backlight so I can see my baby's temp in the dark without disturbing her. I definitely recommend this product to all mothers with little ones.	1
My husband and I loved this set out of all the sets we looked at so we decided to purchase it. When we got home to put the crib together, it had a defective piece which was the threading on the right side panel hole was stripped and a screw wouldn't fit in there.	1
The company makes excellent kites and this is another great product.  People do need to realize this is NOT your traditional kite that you toss in the air and it soars up and up on its own with you just sitting there motionless.  No, this is a &#34;glider&#34; meaning you have to constantly move with the kite to keep it afloat.  It does float very nicely and effortlessly in little to no wind at all, but even with a gentle breez you have to keep moving with the kite to keep it lifted.  What results is a very graceful (almost zen like) interaction with the kite.  It takes a few minutes of practive but you should quickly grasp the concept here.  There are great videos online that demonstrate how this all comes together.	0
My son loves Monster Trucks.  I have been looking for this truck for a long time.  I will be giving this truck to my son on his birthday.  He is going to love it.  Thank you.	0
Bought this toy for my son who is 18 months & my 4 year old daughter also loves it. Hoping this will be a toy we have for many years to come!	0
Its ok. I wouldnt buy it again. The net keeps coming off the back part and small particles are passed through. The big particles are caught. Good for intex pools only	1
Got this for my mother's mostly outdoor cat.  He slept in it the first night and uses it when he's out.  Well-made...seems quite durable.	0
Although I like how thick and creamy this lotion is, I'm not a big fan of the scent. It is semi overpowering. It smells good, but it's just too much. As far as the lotion itself goes, it works really well, and it isn't greasy or slimy feeling. It's definitely good quality lotion, they just need to tone it down on the smelly part.	0
Haven't seen the freezes some others have mentioned, but rarely use the Netfix stuff so that may be why.  Been playing disks here pretty well, which is what one of these is for in the first place isn't it?	1
Really love this eye vitamin, my eyes feel stronger since taking it and even my energy level seems increased! No side effects to report as well.	0
I bought this to doodle around a little bit on my laptop and I have to say this thing is frickin' awesome! It has a really smooth cursor so you can draw a straight line with out having to be messed up. Also it is really good for writing little notes for your self and then bring it to the grocery store. All in all this product is very good with its low price. Must have.	1
Beautiful dress! I am 5' 6'' and about 143 lbs. I normally wear a size 6. I love the floral pattern, it is embroidery, so delicate.	1
Both my daughters greatly loved this charming and sweet film in which Blue, Steve and all their friends are preparing a big musical show. Periwinkle and Side Table Drawer play particularly important roles, but all the gang is here: Mailbox, Mrs Salt, Mr Pepper, Paprika, Slippery Soap, Shovel, Pail, Tickety Tock, Magenta and even the Purple Kangaroo.<br /><br />A particularly great moment is the explanation of how to compose a song, made by G-Clef the Keyboard, who speaks and sings with voice of Ray Charles and by Notes, who are voices by the a capella group The Persuasions.<br /><br />There is humor, there is emotion and there is of course a very happy ending with a great singing finale. A wonderful film for little kids. Enjoy!	0
Did a lot of research before I bought this.  It's compact, has 2-sided scanning, color scanning, tray for documents (that folds up when not being used), feature that straightens scans and it is quick.  Software is top notch, you can save your scans to any location you chose.	0
This is a lot louder than the Wahl  it replaces....but arrived on time and has an interesting selection of 10 modes of vibration so the jury is still out.  Well packed, and arrived within the delivery window I was given.	0
I have had these speakers for about a month now. So for they sound great but you will need a sub woofer to get the full home theater experience. They are a big upgrade from my Sony speakers. Still running on a Sony receiver that I need to upgrade to. The center speaker is the reason I bought these & the price was cheap for the hole setup can't beat it. Movies sound great vocals are clear and load now music sounds good to no complaints so far. Speakers are a nice size not to big not to small I thought the towers would  be to big for my room but everything worked out great are room measures 16x12. Wood color is nice better than the all black my opinion. If you are pondering on buying these do it the price is can't be beat for the quality made by klipisch.	0
Fantastic set. We picked this up for our boys for our latest trip to the beach house and this was a hit with young and old. Nothing beasts Lego. :)	1
Put this in my phone, fully charged it up, and then powered on my phone.  First thing I checked was what Battery Monitor was telling me...it told me it was a 1750mAh battery and that it discharged 7% of the battery in the first 7 minutes.<br /><br />I'll leave it in for a day, but my guess is this one is going back.  Not worth the $13.  It already seems worse than my 3 year old stock battery.<br /><br />If I find out something else, I'll come back and update.	0
Regardless of the other reviews I've read on here, I still took a chance and purchase this watch and I actually love it.  The screen looks very modern and it's a nice size for a watch that can do so much, from texting, playing music, and recording video/audio footage to having wifi and Bluetooth capabilities. It's just like a real phone and I really enjoyed exploring all that this watch can do. I can open up most of my apps on the watch like Twitter and Facebook and I hardly ever have any issues with using them while on the watch. It's pretty durable, I haven't seen any cracks or scratches on it yet and it still looks pretty new.<br /><br />The main thing I love about the watch is how it's compatible with my Adroid phone, that's something that I thought may not be possible. Everything syncs right up and I use it all of the time. Overall, I've had a good experience with it and plan on buying another one as a Christmas gift for my dad.	1
The child unit doesn't mount to the wall so unless you have a tall piece of furniture to sit it on you're kind of out of luck. There is a major delay between the child and parental unit. We can hear our daughter cry out from her room before the monitor picks	1
PROS:<br />------<br /><br />- Cheap<br />- Really Cheap<br />- Really Really Cheap<br />- If it works for you, FANTASTIC!!<br /><br />CONS:<br />------<br /><br />- Not compatible with all iPhone/iPods<br />- Falls apart<br />- Charges very hotly<br />- Can damage devices<br />- Long shipping time (from Hong Kong)<br />- Will stop working after X days<br /><br />Save yourself the headache and just buy a Car Charger that was actually made for Apple products and has some type of quality control.	1
Sensitivity is great the remote works well and it gives you peace of mind with either a door chime or an alarm.I use it every day it works so good I sent for one more foe my back door..well made and work great	1
I have allergy for fake metal, but this is OK to wear and the design is really pretty.it doesn't make you look cheap.	0
They come with carrying straps and lock and keys as well....Good price and value! Recommended to others!	1
battery goes dead too quickly!!!!!!!magnets on bottom of base are very weak and do not hold strong to metal surfaces!!	0
It is the same as the one that I purchased from Bestbuy only it was 39.95 there , I saved 25.00 dollars at Amazon and it is a great product...	0
I use this to catch mail out of my brass door slot so the dogs don't chew it up. It works great. The handle is just long enough to hook on above the slot, the lowered side allows the mail to drop in (even magazines) and my two dogs --get nothing. Its a sturdy well made basket and can withstand two very enthusiastic dogs leaping at it day after day. I'm sure it would be great on a bike too!	0
Great game, Ive always enjoyed the FIFA games. This one is certainly my favorite so far. As we go further the games get more and more life like, its quite amazing.	1
Top notch quality! Will buy few more for my friends. I do not know how seller manage to sell this bag so cheap as it could easily cost 3x 4x times more comparing to the bags being sold on high street	1
The Great Northern popcorn is good. It's so easy to put into a kettle, that a kid can do it. It makes nice popping sounds that remind you of a movie theater. It brings the flavor of the theater to your home.	0
I love this bag. The canvas is very high quality, yet surprisingly  soft.  The leather strap is beautiful and very sturdy.  The lining is well stitched and has plenty of pockets.	0
They are good enough but not 100% cotton like the solid.  too bad.  and smaller than the solid colors too.	0
It's a really nice shock mount and it definitely does the job. It goes well with the Samson Studio GT pro bundle pack, if you're just starting up. Obviously it's suppose to just hold the Samson C01 condenser microphone, but if you're lucky, it might hold a microphone very similar to that microphone.	0
I own several Kensington products and have been pleased with most all of them.  This case is indeed, beautiful but it has some design flaws that a cover/keyboard in this high price range should be addressed.  Firstly and most importantly... It is HEAVY!  The reason that many people buy an iPad Air is because of it's SUPER lightweight (1.5 lbs) design.  Adding this keyboard/case DOUBLES the weight to 3 lbs. You cannot turn the IPad into the portrait position and the clasp on the cover is metal and can hit and scratch your IPad screen.  The cover itself is beautiful and looks very professional.  I just can't honestly give this product any more than 3 stars due to the design flaws...	0
My niece is 5 months old & has hated her car seat for the past 2 months. Once I started using this mirror I can take her anywhere. She loves looking at all the reflections & has really calmed her down! I highly recommend this!	1
What a great game.  I never played the original so I'm coming to this version fresh.  The thing I love about it is that it is something different for the Playstation 3.  The options and different difficulty levels on this game open it up for a lot of replay.  I played through about four times when I originally got the game a year ago.  I've taken time off from it to play some other games and have come back to it having forgotten the strategies I used so it's been fun relearning them.    The graphics are pretty good, I really can't speak to the graphics quality but I enjoy the special effects (the explosions, gun fire, ect).  The art style is appealing but not hyper realistic.      The game has great customization for the soldiers.  Some people care about that type of thing while others don't.  I personally enjoy working to advance my troops up through the ranks and trying to give each his or her own personal appearance.  There is a wide variety of skills to assign but as I remember some are decidedly better than others strategy wise.    If fun and hard turn based games are something you might be interested in I couldn't recommend any game more highly than this one.	0
it seems like every time we get a pillow for my border collie she tears/chews it up. This mat she hasn't tore up. It is very durable and strong ,plus soft enough to ease older dogs and cats. My dog seems to have trouble walking probably due to arthritis and it seems to be helping a lot. If i get another dog i'll definitely buy another one.	1
This is by so far the best phone. Great sound quality. Good tone and very easy to use.  Nice features	1
Unfortunately they didn't work for me. They made me sick and throw up once of the two times I tried them	1
I have looked for an ipad mini cover for months and months.....this is exactly what I was looking for. Arrived on time and the price was great and the value for $$ more than met my expectations.	0
I really love this dress! It is beautiful and fun and can easily be worn in a more formal setting (to a formal wedding, for example).  The fabric is soft and it has versatile detail. I ordered it a little larger than I should have, order your size on this one! I'm very pleased!	0
its really a good looking and well maintained product. the quality and style is appreciated by me , i would really recommend it to other friends and colleagues of mine	1
From last few days I was planning to buy a charger for my iphone. It is because my old charger was not working at all. In a word I have used my colleague charger to charge my phone. So having this one from amazon I was a bit nervous if it work properly. Now I am relived that everything is fine. My phone is getting charged via this Lightning Cable iphone charger.	1
It works well...no problems. I lost original remote as a result i bought this Zenith AKB72915206 LG remote. this is the exact same. I use this still now without any problem.	1
Love the scent, largest bottle of shampoo ever! We pour it into smaller bottles for the shower. Great price for the amount.	0
I bought these a while ago but just got around to using them last week. I don't ever remember the non wound strings being bronze but these are. To me it looks weird but i can adjust.	1
The cards I got from this were Metal Arceus, Suicune, Garchomp X, Hitmonchan & Syther(which at first I thought they were the first generation cards but I then realized they were from the more recent packs, so I was kinda bummed. These cards weren't in mint condition, The Arceus I got had pretty noticeable scratches which made it holographic in places where it shouldn't have been. The other cards had minor scratches. I mean, for the price, It's okay. Overall, I would probably buy this again, just because I like the surprise of the cards. But you dont get all LV X PRIME or EX cards, I only got one, two legendary, and two which were just thrown in there. But its different for everyone I suppose.	0
Bought it, poured it in and it worked instantly. I would use it when needed again, mechanic in a bottle. Would only work for minor problems though, will not work miracles if you know what I mean.	1
This is a good performer and illuminates a fairly large area well. Adjustable motion sensitivity is very good and adjusts fairly easily so it's flexible in applications. Adjustable illumination time is also very good. I use this light to illuminate the area between a detached garage and our house, about 25' x 40'. It provides good lighting for the area, and senses even small animals (cats) from it's mounting location at the roof peak. We are in a rural location, so it also serves as a warning device. I think the only limitation is the mounting bracket, but that can be overcome with ingenuity. I plan to purchase at least two more for carport illumination, and possibly a third for a dark side of the house. It probably deserves five stars, but I just don't &#34;love it&#34;. It is, however, a refreshing change from the junk I've tried recently.	0
The Ipod is my constant companion. I have an extremely large and varied music collection, and am adding to it all the time. Battery life is much improved, screen is very bright. The touch-wheel on the new one seems a bit more sensitive. With the increased capacity I can load music at higher bit rates, 192kbs and above.	1
These briefs did not hold up well with wear.  Started to unravel near waistband.  They tend to crawl up as well after wear and bunch in the front.  Not a great fit after wearing for the day.	0
I have this under my kitchen table, one in my bedroom, and another in my bathroom. I guess you could say I LIKE THEM.	1
These lights are great!  super bright!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Well made tough construction. Aluminum with some great cooling fins. Going to get me 2 more sets. This did come with 2 as advertised.	1
I have only had this for about a week and I am LOVING it. I had to hook mine up threw the toilet (laundry room would be ideal) but I still live it. Instead of picking up cat poop and pee every day all I do is flush the toilet when it is finished with the cleaning process. I have unfortunately experienced the COOKED poop smell GROSS but I just turned on the fan in my bathroom for awhile then it was gone. Has only happened once. I would recommended this cat genie (toilet) to EVERYONE that has a cat. Seriously the person that created this deserves an applaud. No more scooping, no more car litter smell, honestly other then the one time poop cook there haven't been a smell. LOVING IT!!!	0
For the price that I paid, this is not the typical Gucci standard. It just felt cheap to me and it runs through batteries like water.	1
I just received this swimsuit and I'm pretty impressed! This swimsuit is the best one I have ever bought. It fits perfectly but is not neoprene which I don't really care for. The bathing suit was so bright and colorful I absolutely loved it. Also, it came earlier than expected which is always a nice surprise!	1
i bought this as a gift for my niece. oh wow, it is pretty nice.  it offers a lot of style for a tiny price!	0
the game came in great condition. its just the game itself. the most generic story line and low quality graphics for ps3.	0
It's a good read. Some parts will be slow, but many parts are really strange and wonderful. I especially like how Zora has to deal with discrimination from most races... excellent.	0
Nice, small, portable to carry on anywhere. Super bright light, did a good job both indoor and outdoor. Five stars	1
We purchased these to replace an older set of ATT phones that had been dropped a few too many times. We purchased the 3 phone system and have added two more handsets since. The features are great, and very intuitive,the audio sounds great both on the phone and on speaker, great range for our 3000 sq ft home, garage and backyard and all and the phone design is very attractive and slim. We are very pleased with the phones after almost two months of usage.	0
I needed these for a cooking competition I was doing, got it and it was exactly as in picture actually.... surprising enough. did what I needed it to do, very happy.	1
This product has surpassed my expectations and it is, as my son likes to say, really cool. The design itself is quite versatile and I can put it wherever in the house I want. But when on a Sunday, this sits right be the table to accompany some good ribs, steaks and burgers.	1
I got a 2 oz version of this instead of the 4 oz. I feel like I was ripped off. But just be careful because the size is not listed on the product page.	1
We used these when we had to pack just the one suitcase for a flight. They trally helped to organize and keep separate our clothes while allowing us to pack all we needed. The folding apparatus is great! Who knew adding something to your luggage would keep the bulk down?!	0
Sorry this product works no better than water sprayed around the area..... So don't waste your money on it. ok	0
I love these earrings. They are beautiful and just the right size. They sparkle just right. One of my favorite gifts received.	0
Excellent protection for lenses fits well and mounts well on both canon lenses- I have the 18-55 and 75-300 Thanks.	0
Beautiful set for sure but in shipping the box was damaged and scratched. The luggage so decided that if that happened in shipping I know the airport will tear it apart. My previous joy mag bag was only on the plane once. So back it went. I was very disappointed as it was such a beautiful set.	1
I bought this strap mainly to help identify my plain black duffel luggage. I liked that the strap itself was thick and durable.  Setting the combo was very easy...just press a small button with a paper clip and choose the combination. The instructions for setting the combo was placed between the cardboard packaging insert, so I can see how it might have been missed by some people.  There is an indicator on the buckle that shows if the TSA opened it with their key, which I thought was a nice feature.  I was able to spot my luggage very quickly on the luggage carousel.  It survived an international trip and came out still looking like new.  Very happy with this strap!	0
My 13-year-old son hates folding laundry and would get really irritated when he had to fold t-shirt and couldn't get them folded right. This has made folding laundry for a 13-year-old MUCH easier!!! I originally got this as kind of a gag-gift for him for his birthday because Sheldon uses one on Big Bang Theory and my son would comment that it looks much easier to fold like that. Little did I know he would be using it weekly! AWESOME!!!	1
Easy plug n play install.... about 10 minutes to install both lights.  Super bright LED light.  These tail lamps look awesome especially on my black jeep.  The LEDs on the perimeter of these tail lamps come on when lights or parking lights are turned on creating a red LED rectangle that looks very cool.  Obviously all of the LEDs light up when the brakes are applied.  I have had several compliments on this addition.  I can't weigh in on dependability yet as I have only had them about two months.	0
Very special design. I'm really love these socks. I saw there are additional colors for this design and I want to try them all.	1
I use this as my night cream now and WOW. What a change! My skin feels like it has been just moisturized when I wake up. Use during the day for my neck/chest. I'm so hooked on this brand. This is one of the few antiaging products I can use (no nut oils or super active ingredients). Highly suggest for sensitive skin.<br /><br />Things I have noticed:<br />- more even skin tone<br />- moisture!!! (I live in the desert, my skin flakes non stop)<br />- radiance<br />- the smell (nice mint)<br />- NO BREAKOUTS (this is a VERY big issue for me and lotions/moisturizers)	1
I bought this because I find it hard to type on the screen. But using this tools I could now text easily. Great item. Highly recommended.	1
I love the look of this watch. I problem I have is the clasp on the wrist band. The clasp doesn't open flat making it difficult to put on.	0
I love the cybertron series but this one just crushed me. It's so short and there's not much back story. Where did Lockdown come in in the timeline if he was killed in the last movie? At least war and fall of cybertron were amazing. This one gets a meh.	0
I was very disappointed in this video...Not what I expected, the 3 screen format was hard to watch. Would not recommend this version.  Older filming of actual concert was much better.	0
Somewhat on the light side for those who are not new to the topic, but a good book overall.<br />As with most history book, it is hard to undersatnd the lack (or scarcity) of maps.<br />Rather less engaging than Wood's book on Troy.	0
No way could I get my cats to eat this! My vet even had me fast them for a day, but no go - they just could NOT be convinced to eat this formula. (Main ingredient is peas.) What a waste - going back to Iams!	0
Got this for a family member that has an LG 42&#34; TV I was worried that it wouldn't hook up to a different brand but the included optical cable worked and movies sound much better.  Just know that if you put this in front of your TV you might have to put something under the stand as the sound bar might block the remote signal receiver on the set.	0
Great DVD for my home or travel workouts.  Several different levels and lengths of routines.  I would highly recommend this DVD.	0
I have had for quite some time and keep one for grinding coffee beans as coffee tasted so much fresher then the others I use for whatever I need, a smoothie or to puree small amounts for some soups.  Just lots of uses and still going strong.  Would highly recommend this product	0
I approached this movie with huge anticipation.  The director, Jee-woon Kim, has directed some PHENOMENAL Korean movies.  The cinematography in his movies I Saw the Devil and The Good, The Bad, and the Weird is simply some of the best cinematography I've seen in any movie anywhere (American movies included).  If you don't mind subtitles (and you shouldn't) check both of those out.<br /><br />So I was excited that Mr. Kim's American debut was going to be Arnold's return to the big screen.  The previews looked promising and fun.  But something about the movie just felt...off.  None of the action sequences were all that impressive or original, and you certainly don't go buying a movie like this for the plot and characters.  it also seemed like some of the risks and insane cinematography that the director had shown in some of his previous movies was absent.<br /><br />Overall, it's not bad, but if you really want to be entertained, check out the aforementioned Korean movies by Jee-woon Kim.	1
I love this bag and got many compliments on it, perfect for travel and work. my friend ordered the same bag when she saw mine.	0
OMG these things are so loud. The one I started with was whirling and grinding like I was at a construction site!	1
When you have to scan a LOT this is the scanner,  it's pricy but I have thousands of family pictures and I tried a on-line scanning service which didn't workout at what I considered a decent price (I scan to tiff).  The challenge was getting decent software on my mac.  I finally ended up with Presto! software which works real well.  After years of cheap scanners, there really is a difference.	0
Works as expected. MCX antenna connector could be more solid. Overall excellent. Hope I can add the upconverter and other modules in the future	1
This bag is the perfect size for all the stuff I carry on a daily basis. The leather is nice and I love the detachable longer strap. My only complaint is the cell phone pocket on the outside as well as on the inside are too small.

The dress is with good quqality, thank you. The color is nice. And i like the design of the dress, it is very fit on body, and is very sexy. Thank you.	1
This was a fabulous & family friendly movie that I wouldn't hesitate to show to the younger generation.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.	0
I literally bought my Gold N Hot heat cap in 2003. I just used it last night for a hot oil treatment and it works great. I use this cap for coloring my hair and for deep conditioning treatments. Using heat on my hair colors makes them last a very, very long time: I use semi-permanent hair colors and they can last 6 months or more. Heat for deep conditioning helps the conditioner penetrate, leaving my hair very soft and strong.<br /><br />My cap came with a small, thin plastic cap to use underneath it, to protect it from getting wet or sticky or stained. I lost that a few years ago so now I use a few plastic grocery bags.<br /><br />It gets very hot on the high setting, so I usually use it on medium or low. It gets the job done very well. I've worn it for hours at a time with no problems.<br /><br />Sometimes it makes a buzzing noise. At first I found that a little alarming, but no harm has ever come of it.<br /><br />I recommend this product to all my friends. It is a game-changer in hair care.	0
Nice concept I like the light but it requires an unreasonable amount of sunlight to last thru the night even in the summer	0
Eight ounce. Silk Sticks from Bioguard.<br />So easy to use just toss in the skimmer or in a floating chlorinator. I have a salt water pool but need to boost the levels in the spring due to seeding trees and pollen onslaught. The bioguard keeps the chlorine from burning off. If it makes keeping the pool clean easier I am for it. Simple and in the long run very cost effective as you no longer have to shock. Keeps chemical levels consistant.	0
Not at all what I expected. Would not recommend. The tent poles were flimsy and barely held the light material of the tent up. Not good for a twin bed or the floor. A waste of money!	1
When it worked for the first six months it was fine.<br /><br />When it died suddenly, I contacted Mediasonic about the problem. Since it was less than a year old, I was told that it was still under warranty and they would send a replacement upon receipt of the tracking number for my package to them with the defective unit. I followed these instructions and sent them an email on 12/2 with the tracking number. On 12/5 I contacted them and asked if the replacement had shipped. Yes! It had, except that it shipped on 12/5, when they received the defective unit, not when I sent in the original tracking number. To compound this delay problem, they sent the replacement unit via Fed Ex Ground (slower than the Pony Express) and it is now predicted to be thrown at my door on 12/15, a full 10 days since it was mailed and almost two weeks since it should have been sent to me. I emailed Mediasonic about this and how frustrated I was and just received an emailed apology. For the price point, it is not worth this hassle dealing with the company for warranty issues.	0
I got this router hoping to upgrade from the cheap router I had from nearly 5 years ago. I figured for the price, I would be getting something that was decent quality and would get the job done, but it didn't. My signal strength was worse than it was before no matter where I placed it. I couldn't use it even a few rooms away in my house, which was very frustrating. Not only that, but it would drop signal as well randomly throughout the day.<br /><br />After I couldn't take it anymore, I did some research and found a router that I absolutely love! My signal strength improved by a ton and that made my internet speed so much faster! I can use my internet from any room in the house and even outside if I want to.<br /><br />If you want a quality router, get the same one I did on Amazon ------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1rLjrfe<br /><br />I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep people from making the same mistake I did. Even if this isn't the router for you, I'm glad I could share my experience!	1
Love the feel of these shoes but I ordered a half size larger based on prior reviews and it's true that these run smaller than typical.	0
I decided to buy the OtterBox because I alerady broke the iPad screen once after $100 fix i bit the bullet and bought the case.<br />I am not a big fan of huge cases for phones that the Otterbox is mainly sold for. Always have issues with accessories when purchasing phone accessories. For the iPad this is a life saver. My two year old decided that she wants to play her games on the ipad and now takes it over. After many drops, stroller runing it over, milk spills, and what ever 2 year old does it has lasted. She is a great QC department :). I highly recommend	0
Arrived on time and in great condition right out of the box. What can I say it was exactly what I was looking for.. needed a new pop filter for a recording studio I'm leasing space in. Very high quality equipment, easy install.. really simple! Love this purchase!	1
This product only has its look working for it as it isn’t really doing anything as a fan. I can barely feel the air that it is supposed to be blowing. So I just gave this to my daughter as a novelty item in her room. At least it served some kind of purpose.	1

The lack of physical activity caused me to have cellulites on both my thighs and legs, I've done lots of exercise to get rid of them but none of them worked. I had told by a friend of mine that cellulite cream with retinol and caffeine will work and so I ordered this product, two weeks after using it on a regular basis and I have seen a significant improvement. This product is what I'm looking for!	1
Looking decent as same shown in photos Thank You amazon .I saved cost as paint of this type is very costly and as this is digitally print looking decent.	1
very awesome piece of equipment. also does the job! will order again if need be. thanks so much for the help.	1
Package sent was damaged by screws. The screws are in a plastic that poked through and scratched the gold plate. Even cheap aftermarket one have some sort of plastic around the neckplate but not this one. It just got scratched up by the screws	0
It might not be HD but it looks good and is $45 cheaper than something from Bestbuy. Worth the price.	0
These are great starter towels, not meant to be forever towels. Very thin. Perfect choice for getting started in my first place on a tight budget!	1
I have ordered this item before and if the price doesn't go up, I will order again. All ink cartridges are too expensive. I've heard of people who will buy a new printer on sale rather than replace the cartridges on their old printer because it's more cost effective! For some odd reason they don't give you a package option with both black cartridges, the one for documents and the one for photo (225 and 226).  Since I mainly use my printer for printing photos I buy this package which also includes photo paper. I have bought this package a couple of times and the ink cartridges work fine and are easy to install. I would like Canon to give an option for a package that replaces all cartridges including both black ink cartridges, hence the 4 star rather than 5 star rating.	0
Device came to us very fast. Just as advertised.<br />Quality very good  and I would certainly buy again from this dealer.	0

I recently completed my independent CPR certification so I could work with the Red Cross in my area concerning life saving events and other instances where it's important to be trained. My sister suggested I read this book, and since she's a nursing student I agreed. Great choice! It's full of important tips, tricks and support for those that wish to be trained in ways to save a life. I credit this book with giving me the knowledge to pass my certification with flying colors - the author definitely knows what she's talking about. Definitely recommended!	1
In the past, I have always dreaded applying screen protectors to my smartphones.  I have always found them so hard to apply and find that after the application, I usually have air pockets, or didn't align in correctly.  Tech Armor has put those worries to rest!  I opened the package to find that the directions were clear and very easy to follow.  Still, I decided to go to YouTube to watch a video of how to apply it, which made the process dummy proof!  I went into the bathroom and turned on a hot shower to get steam into the air to prevent dust from floating around.  I cleaned the screen with the alcohol pad provided and wiped it down with the included microfiber cloth which made my screen spotless! Tech Armor was also kind enough to include to strips of dust removal tape to get any little pieces I might have missed.  The suction cup is what made this so easy to apply!  It prevents you from accidentally touching the adhesive side of the protector and the fact that you align it up with the home button makes it nearly impossible to align it up incorrectly.  Once I applied it and did the finger swipes, you can see the protector applying!  THIS IS THE FIRST screen protector I've ever had where I have absolutely no air bubbles at all!  I am beyond thrilled with this product!  The icing on the cake is that when I swipe my finger across the screen, it glides so easily that it doesn't even feel like I have a screen protector on!  This product it's first rate from the packaging to the instructions!  The fact that they include a home button sticker to raise it above the protector tells you this product was highly thought out.  It's dummy proof to install and well worth every cent!  I would highly recommend this brand to anyone looking for a quality screen protector!	0
I consider myself a voracious reader...this book in the top 5 of all the books I have ever read. Cried, raged and nodded my head with the insight and sheer joy of this book.<br /><br />Kudos to Paul R. Lipton who tells  a story of hope, clarity and insight into the inevitable truth of aging.	0
Well packaged. I am very happy with this panel. It works very well and is light enough to move around. In fact, I will shortly order another pair of the panel!	1
I've been an Amateur Radio Operator for many years, and have more radios than I'll ever need. But when I see these Baofeng radios for under $50, I can't help myself. I already own the popular Baofeng UV-5R, and the new UV-B5 is even better. The UV-B5 feels more like a quality radio than the UV-5R. Most of the features are similar. The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013). The UV-B5's operating manual is light years better than the operating manual that comes with the UV-5R, and also has a much better antenna.<br /><br />Performance wise, the UV-B5 is on par with my radios costing 3 times more. Transmit and receive are both excellent. Build quality is a step below the more expensive Japanese radios, and the scan speed is slower, but that should be expected from a dual-band radio costing under $50. Audio is excellent, and plenty loud from the small speaker. The 2000mAh battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the battery and charger are not compatible with the UV-5R. The programming cable is.<br /><br />This is just a great, cheap, dual-band radio.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price!!<br />Very good audio on TX and RX.<br />Good battery life.<br />Good sensitivity and selectivity.<br />Great features.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As of June 2013, radio is still only available from overseas dealers.<br />Programming cable not included.<br />Very quirky programming without the cable.<br />Channel skip is only available using the programming software.<br />SMA Female antenna instead of standard SMA Male antenna.<br />Very slow scan speed.	0
This product might be a good product but the fact that I just paid $$ dollars for a product I cannot even use makes this an awful product to me. I do not have an 18 gauge extension chord lying around that I can charge this battery with and I would assume any product like this comes with a chord so you can charge it.	1
I have tried others that clump up, this is great.  It actually dissolves away in hot water.  I use it to imitate Starbuck's green tea late (using sweetener / vanilla creme stevia drops).	0
I bought these to play Bingo with my toddlers.  I also use them for color sorting, counting, and other games.  They are smaller than regular sized poker chips, and easy for my toddlers to pick up.  I wouldn't use for young children if they put everything in their mouths.	0
This watch is beautiful and I loved it on first sight. However, I got the white and the hands do not show up to where you can easily read the time. I constantly had to turn the watch at an angle so I could see the hands. Just too annoying to keep the watch. I sadly had to send it back. The other colors may not have this problem.	1
We purchased this fan because we wanted a clean look without being too modern....and that's what we got. My only issue is that as of today I can't understand how to control the fan speed. It has only one speed and it is very fast.	1
The watch looked big at first but then I got used to it, I sweat a lot so to keep it smelling good I wash the straps every day when I shower, the straps become weak when wet so is not good if your going to be swimming it might loosen up, one nice thing I noticed is that it has three alarms and each one sounds different like a beeper.<br /><br />The buttons are very durable, treat this watch nicely and you will be a happy customer, this watch is not indestructible, I had this for 5 months now and I use it every weekday, I also wear it every day, on my HIIT classes, It still looks new,  I don't even look at my watch, the alarm tells me every time.<br /><br />My most common settings are intervals of 30sec 45sec to 1 min Intervals	1

Works flawlessly. Better than I expected, easy to use (dpad is used to toggle the mod functions). The LEDs on the top change to tell you what mods are on and off and how to change them, very simple, and works like a charm. Well worth it and it is doing wonders for me in Battlefield.	1
I got this toy for my nephew for his birthday. I needed a toy that wasn't going to break and something to inspire him to do better in life. I got the bang for my buck when I bought this. The first thing he did when he got this toy was drop it. But, it still functioned like it was brand new. Overall, it a great plane and my nephew wants to be an inventor now more than ever.	1
Works well and arrived earlier than expected in perfect condition and lived up to expectations. Daughter enjoys playing with Phil as well!	0
I use this for fitness classes three times a week and it has held up extremely well. The material is comfortable to wear and doesn't cut into the skin. However, note that if worn too tight, it does cause severe itching when removed. It's best to wear this at a comfortable fit, not too tight which I tended to do initially. The material stays dry even after an intense workout session.	1
This tape is really worth buying, I have used it for multiple purposes i.e. cables and box sealing and worked perfectly. It’s a top quality product having a very low price. Those who are using other products must give it one shot, hope you'll like it as well.	1
I bought this necklace because it has a very cute design. I give it to my daughter as a birthday gift. She loves it.	1
Before i think car lower and lower, it will look nice. however, i don't consider lower car that it is not easy to drive. i got the new spring, and it drop 2.5". now i want to cry. i can not drive to a lot of places. it will scrap my car chassis, so i decide to buy a top hat to make my car a little higher. i was very surprised.  it works very good for my car. no bad. Now I can drive where I want to go with my new spring.	1
I really recommend this multi vitamin to those who only consume organic products. It is an excellent quality vitamin of four capsules that speaks health benefits and complements an all organic nutritional plan. Additional calcium may be recommended depending on one's supplement enhancement goals.	0
I'm an artist, but I also have OA and fibromyalgia. It's really important that I pace myself - but of course, I don't. I got this cute little cube because you don't have to take the time to keep setting it. It's preset to 5, 15, 30, and 45 and you just turn it to the side you want. (As others have stated, each color cube has differing time sequences. I chose white for the 30 and 45 minute increments.)<br /><br />It is quiet. No annoying ticking. And the alarm is loud and not the kind you'll ignore. It definitely will stop you and make you turn the cube to reset. I also love the fact that you don't see any time showing. When I've set other timers, seeing the fact that there are 10 minutes left makes me rush whatever I'm doing to try to finish before the alarm rings. Not with this one. It's very Zen-like and helps you actually forget time but be mindful when it's time to stop. But yes, if you look closely, near the on/off switch there is a small minute counter. I try not to look at it too often.<br /><br />This would be a great timer for any kind of practice - from piano to homework. Highly recommended.	0
I just used this luggage and was very pleased with the convenience and handling of it. I transferred the contents of my purse to the carry on and those narrow airplane aisles were a breeze. It will make my life through the airports much easier!	1
The item is quite attractive and very reasonably priced.The design and fabrication was very satisfactory.	1
Well I really liked these earrings in the pictures, but after a few times wearing them, the little chain with the ball fell off. Needless to say I wasn't really impressed with the quality. I received them for Christmas, and they broke before January was over. Do not recommend.	0
It does not looks as stunning as it does in the photo. I'll try it with the dress to see if it looks good but it's not that pretty, so.. I don't know.	0
1964's KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, once a political fable, seems less so today. It's still very much a mild-mannered battle of the sexes, a vehicle that Tracy and Hepburn would've had a field day with. Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) - ex-judge, ambassador's daughter, senator's niece - has all the tools in the shed to carve a bright future in Washington, D.C. When a successful campaign has her elected as the U.S. President, her affable husband, Thaddeus (Fred MacMurray), sells his business so he could better serve as the White House's First Gentleman.<br /><br />Polly Bergen is very good and believable as our Commander-in-Chief. She demonstrates firm command in scenes when she's fulfilling her presidential obligations, but then loosens up in those private moments with her husband. Unfortunately, those private moments come few and far between and don't ever last very long. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, for the most part, concerns Thad McCloud's harsh acclimation to his new role. It's a comic study on the trivialization of a man.<br /><br />Did you know that Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel was modeled after Fred MacMurray? His face, anyway. In this movie, MacMurray starts out less the superhero, more the milquetoast. How out of sorts must he have been, relegated as the man behind the woman, hamstrung from voicing his political opinions? As the First Gentleman, he merits an office (dainty), two secretaries (old), and certain tasks (emasculating) expected of his post. One of these tasks becomes a send-up of Jacqueline Kennedy's famous televised White House tour.<br /><br />Another is fairly crucial to the plot. When odious dictator of a third world country, President Raphael Valdez (a cartoonish Eli Wallach), calls on the White House to demand a fiscal loan, the U.S. President's delaying tactic has her assigning her husband to escort him around D.C. I'm not saying that this is an awful idea...<br /><br />Thad is accused by an adversarial senator of incompetence, of sabotaging foreign relations, of sullying the presidential office. Good for Thad, he gets a shot at redemption at the senate hearing. But there's also tension from the matrimonial front. His wife being so preoccupied all the time, Thad has taken to spending (platonic) time with an old flame (Arlene Dahl). She's been cozying up to him, she who runs an empire of man's cologne. She extends him a business proposition that he mulls over, and you The viewer are left talking to the screen. "You silly dupe!" I heard you say.<br /><br />One more sub-plot, and it's an interesting one. It's to do with the McCloud children and how they start to act up. The elementary-grade son (Ronnie Dapo) starts bullying his classmates and even his teacher because he thinks his Secret Service bodyguards will back him up. The teenaged daughter (Anna Capri) and her boyfriend are all the time getting pulled over for speeding and she's been pulling the "My mom's the President" card to get out of tickets. The resolution is pretty mundane. That these kids act up the way they do makes for a fairly fascinating exercise in psychology. It certainly lends depth and dramatic content to the narrative.<br /><br />The timing of the theatrical premiere sucked so bad. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT bombed, and maybe it shouldn't have had. It certainly presents a plentitude of amusing moments and the two leads work well in concert. But the subject matter was a touchy thing in 1964, what with Kennedy's assassination having taken place only less than a year before. An American nation, perturbed and knackered still, probably didn't have it in it to chuckle along. It's almost as bad form as that old joke: "So how'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?" 3.5 out of 5 stars. I took half a star off because of the very disappointing sell-out ending.	0
We bought this for a nursery. It will work for the time being, it's just really short in height.  If you are on a budget it works fine.	0

Neat little bed but how do you get the cat to use it?  I even tried putting it inside a box and spraying it with cat nip.  I think that whatever the bed is made of might be a bit noisy when the cat steps on it or maybe she just prefers the hard floor.  This unused cat bed seems to be holding up well.	0
My family uses the grill most of the summer months so I purchase the bigger containers of seasonings for our meats. This seasoning is a mix between sweet and salty with just the right amount of smoke flavor. My marinade for unthawed chicken breasts and pork loin: In a gallon ziplock bag use 1 tbsp sugar, 1 cup italian dressing and 4 tbsp of the smokehouse seasoning. Mix well and let marinade over night in the fridge. I also use the McCormicks Montreal for steak/burgers and buy it at a Warehouse store where it is cheaper but they do not carry this flavor. Of course, I buy this flavor from amazon because it is only two dollars more and I get free shipping without having to drive to different stores searching for it...	1

I have had turtle beach headsets in the past and generally liked them, which is why I was a returning customer. They weren't the best, but for the price I was always happy.<br /><br />Well, something has changed because this set is unbelievably bad...<br /><br />It was less than a week before one of the speakers stopped working and the only way to get it to work was to bang on it multiple times.<br /><br />I could only keep them on for just over an hour because it would make my ears very sore, something I have never really had to deal with before.<br /><br />I would rate the sound as average, but definitely not better than any other set I have used before. I dealt with them for a while but then I decided to get myself a pair I would actually enjoy.<br /><br />I finally found a good set last month and I have never been happier with them. I can game for hours on end without getting uncomfortable and the sound quality is AMAZING.<br /><br />If you want to take a look, they are here on Amazon actually ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1usTHkS<br /><br />They are hands down the best pair I have ever owned, which you will find yourself agreeing with me if you try them.<br /><br />If you decide not to, I am happy to help point others in the right direction as far as these go!	1

I am so happy to find this cat food on Amazon.

This headlamp is a little bulky but I expected that. It doesnt bother me at all and is very bright.

Premium television sets used to advertise their screen size, image sharpness, and sound quality.  Not any more.  When you buy the latest LG, Sony, or any other LCD, LED, or Plasma display, the speakers are always on the back and very tinny with little bass response.  In short, the television manufacturers do not expect you to actually use the speakers in the TV.  Many diehard audiophiles will decide to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on stereo receivers hooked up to surround sound speakers.  For those with lots of money, space, and the time to set it up, these home theaters can be great.  For the rest of us, we want quality sound from our televisions that is compact and easy to setup.  This is the place where the Sound Bar really shines.<br /><br />There are many brands with some similarities - you typically get a long speaker to go under the TV itself, either on its own stand or mounted on the wall.  There is also a separate sub-woofer for deep noise response.<br /><br />This Sony HTCT260 was an upgrade to my existing Sony HTCT100.  Despite similar names, they are quite different.  To start, the Sony HTCT100 was a total of 250W of sound - three 50W speakers in the bar and a 100W subwoofer.  The Sony HTCT260 is 300W - two 85W front speakers and a 130W subwoofer.  Whether the front is two or three speakers is immaterial - they are all inside a single bar.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT100 had a subwoofer that plugged into the wall, and the audio from the source plugged into the subwoofer.  Then the Sound Bar plugged into the subwoofer with a proprietary cable.  That meant the subwoofer had to be near the sound bar.  However, it also meant that the subwoofer was a receiver in itself, with HDMI pass thru, analog input, and optical input.  HDMI pass-thru means you can plug your Blu-Ray player into the subwoofer, and then plug the subwoofer into the TV.  It had multiple HDMI inputs so the Sony HTCT100 could switch between sources.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT260 does away with the HDMI select capability - in fact, it doesn't have HDMI input at all, and the inputs are on the sound bar, not the sub-woofer.  The sub-woofer is a remote wireless device, so it can be placed anywhere, a major bonus.  It is shorter than the HTCT100 subwoofer, despite being more watts, is easier to conceal.  The only inputs are on the bar itself, consisting of Analog, Coaxial, and Optical.  Why did they make this change?  Consider my use of the HTCT100.  When I bought a TV that had networking capability, it meant that half the time I was using my TV, it was for content from the TV itself.  Since my TV had lots of HDMI inputs, it meant every device could also plug into the TV.  I eventually stopped using the HDMI passthrough and just plugged the optical out from my TV into the HTCT100.<br /><br />Since I assume most people have similar televisions now, the removal of the HDMI inputs and the wireless subwoofer of the HTCT260 makes sense.<br /><br />In terms of style, the sound bar is sharp looking, a little longer and wider than the HTCT100, and with a built-in display, it looks really good in my TV setup.  There are touch sensitive input select and volume buttons on the front, so you can adjust it even if you lose the remote control.<br /><br />Most important, how does it sound?  In a word, amazing.  I was dubious that the extra 50W would mean anything, but I found the sound far more immersive and expansive than with the HTCT100.  Previously on the HTCT100, I had actually hit the MAX and still thought the sound was too quiet for some sources, but now I can crank up the volume and actually get it too loud.  The bass is full and can be felt, but is not overpowering.  Simple "sound field" buttons on the remote allow you to adjust the effect for movies, games, or music.  With the subwoofer placed in the back of the room, I can achieve most of the surround sound effect without having to run wires and place tons of speakers.<br /><br />Finally, pairing the speaker with my iPhone via Bluetooth couldn't be simpler.  I hit "Pairing" on the remote, and about 30 seconds later I was blasting Tchaikovsky through the speakers from the iPhone.<br /><br />Highly recommended - I'm sure you could get better sound with a more expensive system, but bang for the buck, I am totally happy with this sound bar and highly recommend you get one to go with your new television set.	0
This silicone cutting board is very thick and durable, yet its design is elegant and very premium looking board. This premium cutting board is not an easy thing to find when it comes to premium built with its modern design. Most of it on the same kind out there are pretty ugly, and easily get stained and hairline scratches when used with force. But not this one. This silicone cutting board is as durable as I thought. Marks aren't visible even until now after using it for several months and it is still on its brand new looking condition. I have recommended this to some of my colleagues and neighbors and they are very happy with its heavy duty materials that really help this board to stay usable for years!	1
Very good mattress.  Not too firm, not too soft.  I think the top 2 layers of the gel foam and comfort foam make the difference.  So far so good, we've only had it a few days and it's the 2nd bed in my daughter's room.  My wife has used it a couple of nights and she is happy with it.<br /><br />The one thing I was not impressed with is the stitching on the bamboo cover is a joke..  it started to come undone in quite a few spots just as we got it open and it was decompressing.  Pretty minor I guess,  but they could do a lot better in that regard...  minus 1 star for that.	0
This camera is a great deal for what it's selling for. I originally just purchased one camera to test out with the new dvr I just bought. Good color, nice clarity, good at night and during the day. Since ordering the first camera I have ordered another 3 more along with the 50' bnc/power cable. For the price I'd highly recommend this to anyone who's wanting to try out the world of cctv cameras.	1
The shipping was not good, but the head board looks just like the picture, very pleased. we are using this head board in are spare bedroom, the assembly was very easy to assemble and the quality was good.	1
I love these HDMI cables, not only do they look really classy, they still are holding up perfect even today. Great quality for the money. It does the exact same thing as a $50 HDMI cable that I have already. Honestly, the best purchase I made on Amazon. I would give it 10 stars if I could.	1
Great item to play all the time, I just put them in charge again after playing for hours, they will charge fully until I need them again.	1
This is a beautiful rug, very rich looking.  It becomes the focal point of the room.  I paired it with a red couch with yellow, black and white cushions.  It looks good.	0
I travel a lot for work, and this bag is good. Good padded section for my laptop, high quality leather, plenty of space, metal button feet to sit on the floor and long zipper tabs to grip easily even if wearing winter gloves. If I had to complain about one thing, it would be that because of its depth, things can drop way down into the bag - but at least you know it's some where in there!!	1
We just bought this but so far it's been great. I bought this for my son and he thinks the flames are &#34;cool.&#34; It's easy to get him buckled and he can pretty much do it by himself. The only thing I wish it had was a cup holder but we bought this for our second vehicle so we probably wouldn't use that much anyways.	1
UGH I HATE this artwork! However the usefulness of this card far outweighs the dated neon 90's artwork. This guy is King of the Ocean for a reason... despite the acid yellow fin mohawk.	0
easy to use, big screen with everything on it.  wrist band comfortable. for the price I LOVE IT.  i use it to work out.	0
These are so cool! They hardly weigh anything at all, so they don't sit on your sinuses and hurt your head. They are large enough for my husband's big head, yet not so large that they look funny on my smaller head. They are easy to store in the handy case that comes with them and very well made of great, quality materials. The view through the lenses is clear and sharp. I love how they look on your face too!	1
I received this free from Hasbro and my daughter was thrilled to get it!<br /><br />It does come with a lot of pieces, however, most of these pieces are itty bitty tiny pieces that are referred to as &#34;deco pieces&#34;. They pop into the walls but only on on side. She didn't seem to mind that much though. I thought it was a bit strange after I finally figured out it is one-sided holes.<br /><br />The second thing about this set that sticks out is the sink that comes with it. It is cute and the idea is great and all, but it doesn't seem to have much use. My 6-yr-old daughter plays as if it isn't there. She does like the mask that came with the Little Pet Shop set. I was surprised that it actually does stay on the pet!<br /><br />The last thing about it that I have noticed - The wall mount on the bottom right (which is small cardboard) doesn't flatten out well so you can't really sit anything on it. I am unsure why they included this small &#34;surprise&#34; instead of just including a small side table or long-standing table.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to other parents but not without telling them about these things just in case. I was a bit disappoint by this set.	1
Simmply a great product for the money!<br />Worked as expected upon installation.<br />I am very pleased with this product and it's performance.	0
I so wanted to enjoy this game, but everything about it screams "rush hour" as in you are stuck in your car moving at a snails pace. I have never played a fighting game that is sooooooooo slow. Plus many characters from melee are dumbed down to the point of what is the point in them. Just no, awful sequel to a previous great game.	1
This movie is about a extraterrestrial race that is forced in some kinds of ghettos.<br />Most people state that they love this movie but i cannot share this excitement.<br /><br />For me this movie was kind of boring, don't know why this movie didn't attract me.	1
it was my second time to buy,so satisfied it,and this time I orderd 3 pieces.they all fit me perfect	1
I am happy to buy the goods very satisfied with the good price.<br />I think the product is satisfactory enough goods to the buyer.	1
tasty whole grain wild rice. the packaging is great and easy to close back up for later use. serve often with dinner.	1
The watch is a bit small and the band is pretty cheap. The watch itself looks expensive but I hate the way it sits on my wrist and the band is just so mehh....	0
We put this in our RV to replace the hide-a-bed couch that takes up to much room (when used as a bed). How well it actually works will be up to our 12 year old granddaughter. Since she can sleep most anywhere the next revue should be good.	1
OK before all you fans rip me a new one for the rating, you can not deny that this game is short - very - very short.  Even at $20 bucks, it was short.  You guys also can't deny that the controls were a bit glitchy, and the interaction scene areas are not expansive.  I read a lot of the reviews, but I guess that I didn't see the ones that warn that this game has a short play time.  Don't get me wrong,  I loved the interactions, the graphics and the story line.  But I would have loved this game more had it been longer and had some side games.  Fun - just a heads up on the play time.  (which was around 2 hours)	0
I really like how easy they were to assemble. They work perfect at my bar. I wanted a low profile style bar stool and they work great! Very satisfied with the product.	1
This works great for what most men are going to buy for it.  However, the only issue I've had with it is the guard on the razor itself doesn't guard very well.  I've cut myself multiple times with it no matter how gentle or careful I am.  Just be sure that you're very cautious if you use this because it does have the capability of cutting your skin even with the guard down.	0
coffee smelled ok &#34;lite&#34; but no taste at all...out of 4 bags @ 12oz each 2 were great and 2 were, well bad.<br />I'm guessing they used over processed beans, very dry, very dry bean with no taste. tossed out 3/4 of the bag.	0
For me, this tool belt was cheesy. I have had issues with the clip latching since purchase and one of the pockets ripped the first month I owned it. Not the quality I need on a construction job.	1
I started off upset when sticking always to the wall but then quickly became happy when i realized it was my fault because i was peeling the wrong side of the sheet. This product is very easy to stick to walls, you take off the white backing of it, stick the decal to the wall and then take off the clear front of it and wow you have a perfectly beautiful sign. I had no other difficulties beside the one because of my own mistakes. i love this product so far, hopefully stays on my wall for forever. Highly  recommend...looks beautiful!	0
the spring assisted feature of this blade. It's very smooth and it opens like ‘butter'. Would recommend this blade to anybody that is looking for a quality you can't find anywhere else online.	1
I've had mine for a few months and it is still working like new. Its very functional. The back lit screen is a wonderful feature especially for such an affordable gauge. Easy to read, simple to use, seals well, and the auto shut-off is nice for conserving the battery which is potentially the only down side as it costs as much as the gauge to replace. Great buy for anyone who wants a simple digital gauge. This gauge is great and extremely dependable.	1
This is an excellent cam for beginners. And it's a great idea by canon of bundling two lenses at such a great price. Covers both landscape & telephoto requirements. Add a 50mm and you have a complete kit.	1
I absolutely love these boots. I have large calves and always have a hard time finding boots to fit. I bought the &#34;wide calf&#34; size and they fit great. They are very warm and very comfortable!! I walked around a city for 2 days over the holidays wearing them...no blisters at all AND my feet stayed warm!! Highly recommended!	0
My boyfriend is a car enthusiast and he LOVED this when he received it. So far, there isn't anything wrong with this cover.	0
So sexy... great heel, I love them, and perfect for the price!<br />I will buy more from this product line... so far so good...	0
I use these for paracord bracelets.  I tried using the 3/8 size since they were cheaper, but I came right back to these.  They work well and I haven't had a single one break on me yet.  They are easy to thread and I like that they are contoured- they fit better on your wrist than flat buckles	0
This brush isn't bad for getting through tangles, although it does stick a little when you have thicker hair. When wet, it seems to be more difficult to use. All around, the brushes are pretty decent for use on your hair.	1
This helmet was lightweight and fits me well but took a long time to get to my house. Would buy again if shipping was faster	1
The right side of the phone is elevated with this phone. So the left side has a lip and right side doesn't, so it's flush to screen. I'm not sure if this was intentional but it doesn't look right. Quality-wise I didn't feel it any better than other $3-5 cases I have purchased before for my older phones.	1
This is yet another wonderful Spanish film that weaves a truly masterful storyline.  The acting is excellent.  I truly love the lead actress.  The story has an eerie and thrilling edge, and as is so typical of Del Toro, you really don't know where the tale is leading you until that one 'Ah-ha' moment... and then it all falls into place.  I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in a solid film, or if you are a fan of genres such as 'thrillers'.<br /><br />If you like Guillermo Del Torro, you will certainly love this film.	0
This thing spins easily and with very little pressure. It took me a few minutes to get the hang of it, but it turned out to be pretty straight forward. Whatever you do don't pound on the handle. You can start slow and add pressure as the speed builds up. I'm very happy with it.	1
I love this little pump! I had no issues with it, like other consumers had. Perfect & delivered very quickly. Thank you!	0
This watch is GREAT!  Looks Good!  Feel Good! Very Classy Sporty look!  Great bang for your buck!  I would recommend this watch for any and everyone.  I purchased this watch to wear while I exercise, now I may buy another one for my everyday wear.	0
I'm only giving a four because I have only just started them. So far they are awesome!!! They sent me a few more than the twenty listed. I germinated them February 10 and as of today I have 33 seedlings. All are very healthy looking. I have followed the directions enclosed and kept the soil as directed which is atleast 70 degrees. I will buy from this seller again without hesitation!	0
Bought it reading all those reviews of this product. Suddenly I wanted to make a surprize gift for my husband. And yesssss, he was surprized. Happppyyyyyy!!	1
A very decent product is not super long lasting but last enough and more<br />that a normal lip liner , very nice colors , soft and easy to use I completely<br />recommend this product and for sure come back for more	0
I loved the material, the idea and all the rest but it was not the right thing for me... my wrists are so very small that it just didn't work right... each arrangement I tried had a problem so I had no choice but to return it... if a strap without all the extra doodads been available it would have been perfect for me, but I could not find one in Amazon prime...	0
My granddaughter loves it.  Always happy with the speedy delivery on all the items I've purchased from Amazon.	0
This big guy is in our basement right now. He has such a cartoon y looking face we couldn't get over how perfect he is. The scales on his head seem lifelike too.	1
honestly i don't know what is the problem with the negative reviews for this product because it really works, and probably they just didn't know how to use it the right way, but for my PSP is fantastic and i know that there is other ways to transfer music to my PSP but truthfully it takes a lot of time to transfer them and with the help of the PSP Max Media Pro is very easy now.<br /><br />the stuff i have transferred from my computer to my PSP is exactly the same as i have it on my computer, the quality doesn't change. this should be pretty easy to use if you are familiarized with computers and music downloads and all that stuff, if you think it will not be easy for you trust me that it will. all you have to do is follow the directions given to you in the manual.<br /><br />one of the cons is that you definitely cannot transfer movies from DVD, and is understandable because you should have the movie saved in the hard drive of your computer in order to transfer it to your PSP.<br /><br />highly recommended product!	1
I really like the design. I am having it engraved for a graduation present. The quality looks very good even if it does not have the identification sterling silver marks on back.	1
So bad experience. Got defected unit and they got the return and inspected the unit said it was not defected unit. I was very unhappy because they did not check it specifically. When I told them the symptom they said they do not have the item anymore. Also I had hard time to get refund for my extra shipping cost and original shipping cost.	1
No bueno.  This privacy screen negatively affects the resolution.  The screen loses its sharpness and makes the entire surface appear speckled.  When viewed from an angle, it doesn't provide full privacy.  It's only marginally blurred.  Your content is not all that protected.  Installation was easy but the cut isn't precision and is asymmetrical which is visually disconcerting.<br /><br />Final word: Given the choice, I wouldn't buy this again or recommend it to anyone.	0
A deep, resonating sound and visually appealing addition to my yard! I highly recommend this chime if you are looking for a statement piece.	0
I bought the camera to take still photos of scenery when I'm out hiking & or geo caching.  I wanted the 18mm wide angle lens.  I didn't realize until after getting it that I'm unable to add a 5-10 second audio recording when taking stills.    I was planning to buy an AC power adaptor but didn't like the "fake" battery mickey mouse arrangement.  The camera should have a receptacle so the AC power cord can plug directly into the camera.  I never took the camera out of the box & am returning it.  It simply doesn't have a very basic feature that I'd assumed was part of the camera.	1
It's a perfect fit on my daughter's Nabi. And the price was reasonable. I would order it again if I need another one.	0
These stroller clips are a fabulous product. They take out all the heavy lifting, which makes my life much easier when you have to carry all the kids extra accessories around with you. Would recommend to anyone and worth paying a bit extra for the Lifetime Guarantee[[ASIN:B00CKSU82K Stroller Clips - Luxury Stroller Clip Hooks For Diaper Bags - Guaranteed To Last, Won't Break Like The Cheaper Plastic Ones - Carabiner Stroller Clip Locks For Added Security Keeping Your Valuables Safe At All Times - Lifetime Guarantee]]	1
Convenient on last camping trip... wife didn't have to get dressed and bundle up to go out in the cold when she had to go in the middle of the night. Also, would've been great to have when we got stuck in traffic in last season's snow storm... I wouldn't have had to sacrifice my favorite coffee cup.	1
got rid of stretch marks on my wife, skin looked better, and she even lost some weight.  Great choice at a great price	0
For the money you can't beat it!  They're light weight, stay on my face, don't fog up and the yellow tint brightens the trail through heavily shaded woods.	0
I personally don't own, or even like, the Glock. I got this for assisting others and it works very well for that.	0
I ordered a small for my 13 year old son and it just barely fits, I should have gotten a medium.  However he loves it.	0
This buoyant wrist strap from FRiEQ works perfectly to bring your dropped item to the surface of the water, if that is what you seek. The strap is lightweight and comfortable to wear, while being very positively buoyant. If you seek such a strap, I would recommend this one.    We recently received a video camera from SJCam that has a waterproof shell, and have been playing with it in our fish tank and out in the snow (which we have had plenty of these last few weeks). With its waterproof case on, the camera weighs a few ounces so I hooked up this strap to it for our testing... and it went right on up to the top of the tank when let go.    Not too much more to say -- affordable, effective, comfortable and nice looking straps.    As far as hooking this up directly to the camera case (either at a strap port or via a hinge)... it is very easy: make sure that you look closely at the plastic connector on the loop, as this connector allows you to disconnect the loop from the strap. Disconnect it, loop the loop through port or hinge on your camera or device, and then connect the straps back to the loop. Very easy. It seems like some may have missed this, and tried instead to push the straps through the loop...    Neither the Amazon sales page or the retail packaging provides information on a warranty, so if an issue occurs I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive these straps gratis from the seller and put them to use in our fish tank to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.    If you are looking for a high quality pair of highly visible floating wrists straps of this construction, size, style and price, for use as I have noted above, them we would recommend giving these wrist straps from FRiEQ a try based and our experience with them.    Recommended.    Go for it.	0
My husband uses this to &#34;crinkle&#34; his hair on top.  It's AWESOME.  It literally holds until you wash it out.	0
Almost perfect. They shrink after about 10 washes, but I find that if you just hang them instead of throwing them in the dryer, this doesn't happen.	0
I was so excited to get this coffee grinder.  It's a well made and design coffee grinder.  Really easy to use and maintain. The burr is made from durable ceramic, which the ground coffee won't have metal smell and will never rust.  The metal parts are stainless steel, which are durable too.  Another great design is at the bottle of the grinder there is an anti-slip silicone cover, which can prevent the grinder from slipping around and better delivering the force when grinding coffee beans. The grind adjustment nut inside allows you to grind coffee powder into different sizes (finer or coarser) Pros: Nice design Easy to use Made from durable materials (ceramic, silicone, heatproof glass, stainless steel) Easy to clean Can adjust the coffee grind I didn't find any cons yet.  My husband and I both really love this grinder.  Excellent product!	1
First, let me warn you about the instructions of the markers. When I got them I was so excited that I opened the package without hesitation. I used one and nothing happened, no ink, no nothing; and I thought &#34;they don't work!&#34; and then, I had an aha moment when I saw the instructions on the marker! The steps are so easy to follow that even my 3 year old daughter was helping me with the first two. So make sure to read the instructions to initiate the flow of the ink.<br /><br />I like the chisel tip to make broad and fine lines. They don't squeak.<br /><br />The markers were just as expected, and they are great quality. They also arrived two days earlier than expected!<br />The color is vibrant and really stands out. And they don't have a strong odor that can give you a headache. And because of that I let my daughter use them on her mirror. She couldn't believe me when I told her to do that (because that doesn't happen around here), she ran as fast as she could before I change my mind!<br /><br />I can use them on my Pyrex to make sure someone won't take it by mistake at gatherings, or for my &#34;to do list&#34; just in case I loose the paper version, or my daughter might think daddy's car needs some color! So many things.....<br />The only color I wish they have is purple, my daughter's favorite color! We ended up using red and blue and voila, purple!<br />But over all, I LOVE them!<br /><br />I should say to use caution when replacing the cap as it can catch on the marker top and mash it. My daughter did that to a couple of them.	0
When i first saw the watch I was like "that watch looks good" but when i got it, it was like "HOOLLYYYYY...this watch is AWESOME". Liked it a lot.	0
Great price and quick shipping.<br />Was easy to use and get the cats to swollow.<br />Cats has had no isssues with worms after use.	0
I really like this razor.  My fiancé has a beard and moustahe and he used to think all you had to do was grow the facial hair and that was that.  You do need to trim it.  Trimming your facial hair, shaping it separates a good looking man from a mountain man.  However, he doesn't like to trim it himself, so I do it.  This razor makes it a snap.  The regular blades are for the neck and yes gentlemen the hairline.  The smaller trimmer is for trimming those lose hairs, long hairs, side burns, moustahe, and tight spaces.  I absolutely love using this.  When the little blade is out the large one stops working.  You can lock the razor to 'on' so that you can either do quick zip trims without locking the razor on, or you can lock the razor on to shave your whole face.<br /><br />The blades are easy to change.  There is no tugging on the facial hair or face which is a complaint my fella has had in the past about electric razors.	0
Much thicker and heavier than a regular shower liner. Can't see through it. Very good value. Only drawback it that the vinyl smell takes a few weeks to go away and a month after I put it up the folds that are there from when it comes out of the package are still there.	1
The picture is not very good. The sound is poor and can't hear much. If you want a camera where you can see and hear, buy something else.	1
I've owned these for several years and they are still in perfect condition! No cracks, chips, etc. the perfect set espresso shots!	0
Dont waste your money on this, I might as well have gone to the dollar store to buy the same thing because it is not silent and my dog has no reaction to this at all.<br />Please dont leave in the same time, you can leave 1 today and 1 tomorrow	1
They work very well for my wife. My wife uses it when she is doing her hair and spraying hair spray and it keeps her nose from burning. This product is one I would recommend to anyone with allergies or people that use hair spray. The product is easy to use and almost invisible when in your nose.  It was easy to get used to wearing and kept them all around the house to grab when my wife went outside. I highly recommend this nose filter.	1
Love this hand creme. My hands are bit darker when compared to my face and i use this product daily inorder to help me with the discoloration. So far, this product is great and hands seems to brighten up.  Highly recommend this product!!  I received this lotion during a special promotion and am pleased to share my honest opinions!	1
Easy to apply and great protection for the floors- highly recommend.( should actually come with the stand- but I guess everyone would not need it?)	0
The Hitachi right angle driver is a great weight, high quality tool that I use often.  The button has a variable intensity that works well, and it's small enough to get in tight spots.  And I knew it wouldn't be super-powerful with just 12volts, and I was right.  Larger bolts won't budge with the Hitachi.  Lug nuts? Fuggetaboutit.  My buddy's 18v Milwaukee leaves me jealous.  I guess that will need to go on my Christmas list.<br /><br />So, bottom line is it's a top quality tool for light work, but lug nuts and the like are out of the question.	0
My father threw my laptop throught window just because i am watching the final ep of How i meet your mother again (the last time he turn off the TV) I dont know what he was thinking. At that time all the screws in the laptop came out. I bought this toolkit when finding for a solution and fix the laptop after i got the package and it helped me to make the laptop works again :D.	1
I bought this after years of convenient point and shoot cameras, because I missed the days of my old 1978 AT-1 SLR.  It provides a great transition from fully "don't think, just take the picture" mode to full manual.  While I'm not an expert photographer by any means, I find that this gives me the tools to learn and go from "consumer" to "pro-sumer".<br /><br />I thought I'd add a my review because I had 2 problems within 3 months of purchase - first, the grip rubber issue (google it), and second the live preview button quit working.  Both are worth mentioning because Canon quickly and efficiently repaired both for free, including shipping!  I know it's bad that we have to call out excellent customer service these days, but it's good to know you're taken care of when you buy Canon products.	0
I am giving 02 star negative because I have been using this product for last 07 weeks and don't get any response. I lost my faith, time and money.	1
Good but could be deeper so a toddlers bottom and legs are further back. Also the back could be higher. Definitely a quick and easy solution to the book stacking of years ago, and reasonable price. Best feature is it collapses easily to be stored in a closet.	0
What a great read!  The author paints a beautiful backdrop to a thrilling story line as you travel with the characters from California to Texas to Hawaii.  Lots of flying woven throughout.  I couldn't wait to get to the next page.	1
Bought them for the wife and she was very happy with them. She thought they costed me way more then what I paid for them. I'm very happy that I bought them for the price they offered it.	1
These were difficult to keep on our small dog and we had to get another diaper to go on top of it. They worked fine with the second cloth diaper.	1
So, I got these to take on vacation, so I could listen to my music without disturbing others and I love them. When turned on, they have a blue light that blinks every few seconds, but I asked and that did not bother those around me, and I can't see it unless I'm in front of a mirror or in a dark room. I'm no audiophile, but the bass sounds solid to me and the mids and highs are crisp enough for me. I have not had to charge them since the initial charge, and that was two weeks ago. I listen for 1-3 hours a day. The controls are not as intuitive as I'd like, simply because they are exactly the same on each side, so if I forget which side the volume is on I can accidentally skip forward or back a track by using the those controls on the other side. They are very comfortable, and I wear glasses, even, but after about 3 hours I'm ready to take them off. I've taken calls on them and the person on the other end says it sounds fine, but it sounds a little funny to me because my voice is muffled and I'm always afraid I'm talking really loudly. I'm really happy with them.	0
Flimsy, cheap, and not even worth the little money you spent on it. I'm glad I only got one of them, because I wouldn't ever think about getting another.	1
I thought the pens would be a great thing to use with my iPad and also my iPhone, but the tip of the stylist does not hold up it either goes flat or it tears  Would not recommend these to anyone	0
This Elite Tactical Folding Knife came in much earlier than expected, which was a great start to my weekend! The blade came sharp right out of the box and the spring assist was a beauty! I've never seen anything made so well, at such a cheap price point, compared to all the other competition that I've seen out there.<br />The dark green handle, looked great and feels extremely comfortable with the G10 handle material. I was very impressed with how simple this knife looked and nearly forgot that it was a rescue knife, as I was able to test out the glass breaker and seatbelt cutter at a nearby scrapyard on some old cars.<br />I would recommend this knife to anyone who believes in a practical utility knife, as this product is definitely worth every single penny. What a steal!!!	1
This lazy Susan works very well for my spices. Be sure to measure your space before ordering to make sure it fits.	0
Durable. Has two holes for easy winding/access of doody bags. Only downside is our golden gets excited and tries to chew it every time we get ready for a walk. He broke the last one (NOT THIS BRAND), but hasn't been able to break this one. I wish they made aluminium versions. My wife gave me the cloth version yesterday, but I am sure we will use this as our backup.	0
I've owned this joiner for a few months now and have used it in both my shop and on location with great success. My only complaint is that it does NOT cut a '0' (zero) sized biscuit and I have recently had two situations where I could have used a unit that did; 1/2 inch Baltic birch. The build quality is very good and dust collection was pretty good. Perhaps a very small annoyance was the balance and lack of forward handle to keep it firmly against the edge of the piece being cut.	0
Love them, they fit perfectly, however, I did order a half size bigger, but I always do with running shoes. They are light and well cushioned, besides that they really look cool. I got them in black neon something.	0
I purchased 3 of these fans after much research about 4 years ago for my new outdoor patio.<br />I have since moved to another house and once again I am in the process of building another patio. I was surprised to find these fans still available. Normally items are discontinued right after I purchase them!<br />I loved these fans. They were priced very well and very high quality. The only issue I have with them in the 4 or so years I used them was with the off and on switch on the side. I operated them from a light switch but sometimes I had to jiggle the switch on the fan to get them to start.<br />I can see this second purchase has a different switch so I assume they found the problem and corrected it.<br />I would highly recommend these fans.<br />I would watch the pricing though. I just bought them for $158.00 at Home Depot. This guy is charging too much.	0
This doesn't work well at all. You only get 4 channels. And his is in the heart of a great cable Area. Won't buy from them again. Doesn't work	0
Followed instructions as provided with a healthy diet and exercise. Did not see anything different in weight, appetite or anything.	1
Seems to work okay. It was delivered very fast and well packaged. Just used it 3 times and so far no issues.	1
good product. i use this product but not very good. i am not satisfied<br /><br />hi I am rizvi20146(skypee name) contact me<br /><br />I am a professional amazon worker.	1
This suit is well made; the colors pop, the materials are high quality and the style is indistinguishable from much more expensive brands. However, even in the largest size, it's still too small for my size 8 bottom. The neoprene has no give so it cuts off my hips, causing an unflattering bulge. The only inner tube I want at the beach is the one I float in while sipping my cocktail! I should have known better when other size 2-4 reviewers were ordering Larges. This suit is super cute and it makes me so sad to send it back, but unless you have a straighter more &#34;boyish&#34; figure or are very very fit, this may not be the suit for you.	0
I really enjoy my stainless steel sports water bottle. It reminds me of a thermos, but it is even better than a thermos! I put my hot tea and hot water, and the bottle keeps the fluids hot for hours. I cannot believe how well this bottle works out! Thank you fresh taste!!!!!!	1
I work at an eye clinic and gave these out as gifts and they were very well received! They match well to outfits and the crystals in between make them dainty. I wish the &#34;eyeballs&#34; were a little smaller but it's not that big of a deal. I would say the beads are about the size of old-school pencil erasers. The elastic makes it easy to fit all wrist sizes. I wear mine a few times a week and being in healthcare, wash my hands a lot and sometimes get water on the bracelet but have not had any issues with tarnishing or crystals falling out. Not bad at all for the price!	0
When it says extra oversized they are not kidding! Lol very pretty! Only complaint is they're tight on my head :/ hoping they will loosen a bit.	0
Opened proper size package, installed ink cartridges and immediately read as empty, 30% quantity. highly disappointed unable to print return label as the cartridge is empty..	1
Great product.  It really works.  I would recommend this book to those of you who are looking for a great detox diet.	1
absolutely beautiful. i bought it to use with a relatively heavy pendant and it works perfect! couldn't have bought a better chain for the price.	0
This very attractive watch has drawn very complimentary comments from friends and co-workers. Its unique design, one moving hand and the hour in a box like watches with dates draws a lot of attention	1
First day arrival and cut (an update will be made after I've had it for awhile) Manuals: - One for the mower and one for the battery/charger - Exceptionally easy to understand in English and I assume in Spanish (included) which I'm unable to understand - 10 year warranty on motor, 4 on mower, 2 on battery and it's your cost to send it in or drop it off for repair Mower - Looks very slick - Mulch plug was installed on mine and can be removed and installed with a light touch - The bag looks like it's very good quality but we have no plans to use it - The battery (40V 146Wh) came 45% charged and charged to full strength from that point in 1 hour and 10 minutes - The battery is installed and uninstalled just like you'd do it on a cordless drill - The &#34;sweep&#34; on this mower is a flexible plastic rather than the soft material (e.g. rubber) found on other mowers we've owned Operation (the cut) - The height adjustment is very easy to use and is well designed (see engineering section) - The start instructions are simple; hold the button (easy) and pull the safety bar back (easy) and let go of the button when it starts - The mower is so quiet you could cut at 2AM and nobody will wake up - My end unit town house required 25% of the charge - I saved a lot of time (10 min on what was a 30 min job) without having to retrieve, hookup, shift around, curl up, and store a cord - The mower mulches better than the electric unit this replaced (a bit of grass in the mulch plug when I was done) - Very little grass stuck to the underside of the deck (deck is non-metal and strong) - The cut is level Engineering (If Greenworks Engineers are reading - Good Job) - The carry handle is very nice (more like fantastic) - The battery may be installed and uninstalled with the mower handle up or down - The cams on the mower handle saved time folding and unfolding the handle - The height control lever sticks straight up so when the mower is on the side for cleaning it does not contact the ground - It's a light unit	0
... a cheap one from Harbor Freight and this Hitachi.  The Hitachi is a quality tool.  It works smoothly and I've never had it jam.  I can't say the same about the one from HF.  The Hitachi quality costs more, but it's definitely worth it.	0
Whether evaluating presentation, performance, ease of operation, versatility, this  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBGGV6  is without a doubt one of the best you can get these days at this price level. It's a large sound bar plus subwoofer and satellite speakers set that support just about any type of 'wired' connection including HDMI  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NH126Q0  out with ARC and can also pair and play off Bluetooth supporting devices such as phones or tablets.<br /><br />Just to get it out of the way, I am going to start with the negatives, few as they are and will follow with a detailed description of what you are getting. So, here are the negatives:<br /><br />- Partially wired. The satellite speakers are in fact wired to the subwoofer, probably a small price to pay for true surround.<br />- 5.1 surround, not 7.1 or 7.2. Yes, it's a sound bar, not a full surround speakers set.<br />- Can't play off USB thumb drives or SD cards directly. You will need some Bluetooth device for that.<br /><br />And that's it, all the negatives I can think of so let me discuss the system overall.<br /><br />PRESENTATION AND PACKAGING<br /><br />As I noted above, this is a massive set and Vizio did an excellent job to get everything in a neatly organized box with all components clearly labeled and easy to locate. This is what's in the box:<br /><br />∙ the 54&#34; bar<br />∙ subwoofer<br />∙ 2 satellite speakers<br />∙ remote control and batteries<br />∙ cables: optical, stereo RCA 3.5 mm, coax, HDMI, 2 satellite speaker, 2 power cables  http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00NH126Q0<br />∙ mounting hardware: 2 sound bar wall mount brackets, 2 sound bar wall mount lugs, 2 satellite speaker wall mount brackets, 2 satellite speaker wall mount lugs<br />∙ wall mount template<br />∙ 4 Velcro cable ties<br />∙ Quick Start Guide<br /><br />All of the above are quality items and I experienced near zero frustration getting them out of the box. Even better, just in case you may wish to return your purchase, there is a nice diagram on the box that shows exactly where everything is so, for as long as you don't destroy the Styrofoam it should be easy to get everything back in.<br /><br />SETUP<br /><br />Getting everything to work was quick and easy.<br /><br />The Manual is very well written and it covers and illustrates the speakers layout, mounting and how everything is connected. It explains clearly how to use the HDMI's ARC feature with your TV (make sure that the TV supports it if you are going to buy a new one) and how to wire several devices to the bar, taking advantage of its many ports.<br /><br />By the way, you get: RCA Analog Audio In, Optical, 3.5mm Analog Audio In, Digital Coax Audio In, HDMI Out (ARC), HDMI In and USB. And, of course you can pair wirelessly via Bluetooth. The bar supports aptX, allowing real-time streaming of high quality stereo audio over Bluetooth.<br /><br />OPERATION<br /><br />The set comes with a great, simple and effective remote control. It really comes down to selecting the proper input and then let it roar, so to speak. The manual explains how you can integrate the system into another 'universal' remote. I haven't tried that yet but it appears to be very much the standard remote 'learning' process.<br /><br />The subwoofer has a wireless link to the main bar which was properly set in my case but, just in case, there is a pair button also. All wires are properly labelled and, as I noted already, the manual explains how you can have several devices connected. All was quickly done for my experimental setup involving a TV and a gaming console.<br /><br />When paired with a Bluetooth device, your phone or tablet or laptop have complete control over what is playing on the bar.<br /><br />PERFORMANCE<br /><br />Getting to the final question of 'how does it sound', the brief answer is 'it sounds grrreat'. Thanks to the satellite speakers, this is true 5.1 surround, not a simulationand it's done through some good quality hardware.<br /><br />Talking specs, this is what you get:<br /><br />∙ Sound pressure Level (system): 104 dB<br />∙ Frequency response (system): 45 Hz - 20 KHz<br />∙ 2 3&#34; full range transducers (bar, one left and one right)<br />∙ 2 3x6&#34; bass radiators<br />∙ 3&#34; full range transducer (bar, center)<br />∙ 2 3&#34; full range transducers (one per each satellite)<br /><br />SUPPORT AND WARRANTY<br /><br />Vizio promises lifetime support for the product to cover setup, connecting and technical problems. They also have a one-year limited warranty.<br /><br />RATING<br /><br />I have no choice but award Vizio's bar 5 stars because I love it. It's as close to ideal for anyone looking for a 'serious' bar to work with a large TV that delivers great surround and plays off mobile devices. Get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SMBGGV6	1
well made, even though the stands fit a little too tight inside and this makes it a little harder to get them in or out. If not for this, I would have given 5 stars.	0
Awesome! Compared to other virgin coconut oil capsules I have tried before this one is the best if not the only high quality virgin coconut oil capsules out there. I strongly believe in the efficacy of this product, it helps sharpen my mental focus and it gives me an energy boost especially when I'm at work.	0
I just got this bracelet today I love it so much that I'm getting another one and I  will tell a friend	0
I don't know why I thought this mattress was totally memory foam. It has a really nice sized topper, and traditional springs underneath. I'm really not disappointed - this mattress is an amazing value. It is super comfortable, and laying on it feels like it could be memory foam all the way through.<br /><br />An excellent way to take this one step further without paying the high price for a full memory foam mattress is to add another separate topper to this one.	0
The perfect keeper for my mini bose headphones.  I love the individual pocket for the charger and exactly the right size	0
These two small tweezers perform beyond my expectations,they are compact and light weight to I can use them to do very delicate work such as fixing my iphone,and it is Anti-magnetic so I don't have to worry about the small screws!	1
My ring came in very quickly and the size was perfect for the finger I intended to wear it on and it is so pretty.  It also came in a lovely jewelry box.  Service.......quality............just dandy! Thank you.	0
Great sturdy pockets. Great for all your needs. I know most people will wish to have deeper pockets but from the design you can't really add deep pockets or else the entire item would hang much too low on the back of the seat.	1
The difference in taste between tea bags and the loose tea leaves has to be tasted to be believed.  I bought my first box of Lipton and I'm really impressed with the taste, especially for this price.  Just don't expect it to be able to hold ground with most of the premium teas out there, but for someone new to loose teas, I would recommend to them in a heartbeat.<br /><br />And if you like the taste of this Lipton black tea, I'd suggest also trying this sampler; [[ASIN:B00HC582FQ Organic Black Teas Loose Tea Trio Sampler - Earl Grey Crème, Sweet Almond Wild Berry, Pumpkin Spice Chai]].  A little different from the plain black teas, these are full-bodied and full of flavor...depending on the blend.<br /><br />This is why I love loos leaf teas sooo much.  Each one is different from the next, all with their own personality and flavor.  Oh and If you like pumpkin pie, you'll fall in love with the pumpkin spic chai in that sampler.  Simply to die for.	1
I started exercising and losing weight and getting into shape about a year ago and let me just tell you it has been the most rewarding journey for me, I look great and I feel better than I ever have in my life. I owe part of it to these pills. These raspberry ketones are all natural and all pure, so basically 100% pure raspberry ketones, with nothing else added to it, they also supply 500mg of raspberry ketone which is a high dosage and will surely help. I started taking them late last year and they have put me on the right track.<br />I have managed to lose about 35 pounds during the whole journey and I couldn't be more proud. This wasn't all accomplished through the pill, I wish it was that easy but the fact is I had to work and I had to work hard! This pill combined with proper diet and exercise can help you reach your weight loss goals. If you're already on a diet and exercise scheme and needing a little help, try these pills.	1
I will keep this dress because I have several occasions to wear it where I am not in a professional situation. It will require a slip as itis PAPER THIN. If you are not a &#34;slip&#34; type, this is not the dress for you unless you are an exhibitionist. LOL	0
The splitter works just fine for video. Yes, it does get a little hot with continuous use as other reviewers stated before.<br />I bought mine in October 2013, and it does remove HDCP protection (tested with a PS3) which is the main reason you might be taking a look at this item.<br />It is quite small and &#34;portable&#34; (sans the power supply) so you would have no problem hiding it.<br /><br />The main issue with my unit (perhaps defective?) is that the sound will either crack or just be gone completely. I'm yet to find out if the problem is due to the TV, the capture card ([[ASIN:B00840353W Elgato Game Capture HD (10025010)]]) or this unit, but in any case I don't lose too much sleep over it as I'm using optical audio to playback and record (as opposed to audio via HDMI) but it's definitely something you should have in mind, if not using the optical out port of whatever device you intend to capture.<br /><br />Overall it works for my purpose (HDCP breaking) and I'm happy with the product, but I already found a similar product (not on amazon so cannot link) that apparently works and doesn't require a power supply, so I might be heading towards that direction (the power supply is something I quite not like that much about this product, as it's one extra thing to be taking space on my -already getting crowded- UPS).<br /><br />I haven't had the chance to try 3D yet to see if it works, maybe when I do I'll come back and update the review.	0
This item is well made and sturdy. The quality of workmanship is very good. It now is perched upon my new backyard shed and gives me much joy as I see the weathervane turn with the wind. This product was well packaged and arrived within the promised delivery timeframe.	0
I use this battery in my Truck and have had no problems with it yet, I also use a small trickle charger [[ASIN:B004LX3AS6 NOCO Genius G750 6V/12V 750mA Fully Automatic Battery Charger and Maintainer (Grey)]] though on all my vehicles and it will extend the life of these batteries for sure.	1
Review: Not good at all, it just looks kinda shoddy. I figured for the price I'll take a risk but I will probably return it first chance I get, wish I'd trusted the reviews.	1
A fabulous teether. I use this with lots of links so it doesn't constantly fall to the ground. My 6-month old loves this teether!	0
Great quality and very pretty. Purchased as a replacement chain for my wife's diamond pendant. The chain is so much flashier than the box chain it replaced she could wear the chain with no pendant.	0
When I received them I thought the weight of the box was usually light. It is if you are expecting quality mats. The mats are not good quality at all. Highly disappointed, and with their no return policy I am stuck with them. What a rip off. Don't buy them.	0
These lures only dive for a fraction of the troll, then they come to the top. I troll at 1.5mph and they will not stay down at all. I'm not happy with this product. Hope this helps with your decision on a purchase.	0
First ride on my brand spanking new wheels (Tires , Rims & tubes) hit a railroad crossing these ran flat IMMEDIATELY , one complete blow out and one rather large leak . Patched them and they ran flat by blowing out in another part .	0
It is adjustable all right. Then the weight of anything you hang on it pulls on the adjustment, so it's no longer tight on the door, then it tilts, then gets jammed in the door when you try to close it. We even tried to glue it to the position we needed it, but the cheap metal bent - from the weight of a winter coat. Don't bother with this product. Not worth my time or effort to return.	0
Not a huge step forward for the Gran Turismo franchise. Not a terrible game, but I lost interest pretty quickly. Also, I miss the endurance races.	0
Lookin gud when I got it from da mail<br /><br />Smelled funky<br /><br />Worked aite<br /><br />Then it bumped da ground and did not want to speak to me anymore...<br /><br />Was an alright headset til it stopped talkin to me...	1
the game was fine but not a huge fan of the campain but everything else was alright it came with the manual and original artwork	0
Loved the price! Fast shipping! Hasn't given me any problems! Wish it was some bigger but the heat temp on it is wonderful. I would buy it again.	0
Perfect shoes, did not like the colour so gave them to a grateful recipient , Will be on line ordering again in a different colour later this week , ALEA GADDAFI LOVES THESE	0
I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me. I am walking proof that there is SOMETHING out there that works!	1
These gloves are a great fit and allow ample feeling in the finger tips and these gloves also allow you to work without taking them off all the time.	1
9.This product is amazing! I love that it holds my Samsung Galaxy S3 to perfection and how easy it is to rotate my phone without the worry of it falling down or getting lost among all the stuff that I carry in my car. Very affordable and amazingly practical. I totally recommend it to everyone who is looking for a great holder that secures the cellphone very safely. I even use it to hold my Samsung while it charges, so again, very very good!	1
i dont know where to begin with this the biggest problem is that after a very short amount of time they start to fade and look and get this whiteish color, then a few weeks later they start peeling, some sort of flaky peices keep coming of the mats till it got a hole in one of them then i just through tem out, waste of money and time	1
This actually works for my long curly hair and is a nice change from my regular flat iron.  I like the rotating two way aspect too.<br />I would recommend this tool.	0
I didn't like this scent as much as Maroma's Cedar Lavender.  It sort of smells like a neutral laundry detergent to me. Also, it has rough moisturizing beads on it. The bar does last a while (though it eventually splits in 2 due to the thin nature of the bar).	0
I am injured so spend a lot of time in bed.  This mouse works great for laying in bed and surfing!<br /><br />Thanks Microsoft!	0
I had to buy some of these for work, naturally I wear skinny fit jeans because i'm a skinny guy. they fit perfectly. They aren't super loose when you first get them, and they don't get super tight after the first wash. Great item, super comfy.	0
It is very easy to use, works great and I love the color. It picks up vibrations on the neck so you can tune ease and accurate. it's just unbelievably fast and seems to be accurate. I recommend it, do not hesitate to buy this product, the best I've bought this season.	1
Used the same pot with the water at the same starting temperature, and guess what. This little stove only took 35 seconds longer to get the water to a ROLLING boil. My tablet stove never got above a simmer and steam.The fins which hold the pot above the burner, make sure you FOLD THE TOP OUT before placing your pot on top. Don't try to cook with the fins folded in like the picture for the product.The igniter for this thing is such a very nice addition.	1
I bought a couple of these to store various places for my iPhone. I keep one in the car to charge in my car's USB port, which also lets it function as an auxiliary port to listen to music from my phone. I have another by my computer to upload. Then I don't have to keep grabbing my original cable I charge my phone with by my bed at night. These cables work just as well as my original Apple one. I am super pleased!!	1
It is a fun game.  I would recommend this computer game to all ages.  It is a good gift for teenagers.	0
This case holds everything snuggly.  The only issue I have is that the opening for the power supply is to small so my cable only barely plugs in and falls out if the device it touched.  All I had to do was cut the opening out wider.	0
The bottle I bought from here has a smell and it cannot go away with several times of washing. However, the other Sigg products I ordered were not like that.	0
I like the pendant. Its cheap though but i like it. Its a fashion thing. I got this for my daughter and she likes it.	1
The dots were larger than I expected. pale colors and beautiful shimmer on the glitter dots. Overall I am pleased with the purchase. I would say they are overpriced for the item, but beautiful non the less...	1
I didn't know that much about modded controllers. I just needed a new controller and thought I would try this. I almost sent it back, because it was making the automatic guns slower, by a lot when using rapid fire. I read some more on the controller and figured out the rapid fire is for single shot only. Pistols and FAL are my favorite on Black Ops II. I really enjoy the auto aim too, you just pull the trigger and it aims at the same time. The quick scoping is fun to play with too. If you need a new controller or just wanna play with the mods, get one of these. FUN!	0
The movie's more than cute, funny, and (at 81 minutes) brisk enough to move families in and out of the multiplex in mass quantities, like the social insects we are.	1
bought this for my boyfriend because hes been asking for it for over a year. finally bought it for him and he loves this game. he could play it for hours. its a computer game. hence PC	0
I bought this to connect my SUN workstation to the DB 15 connection on my SUN monitor. It did not work as well as the one supplied by my IT department. For some reason I am only getting VGA resolution in the middle of the screen. The one from the IT dept. got me the full resolution on the same cable.	0
I am in the middle about this table. While it is very sturdy the picture shows a table with six chairs (which is what we ordered) but the table is only large enough for four chairs. The table top also came with a slight ding on the top. The chairs that go with the table are beautiful and quite sturdy though.	1
These are great and the price is amazing. I have seen similar in the stores that cost much more. This took my king sized comfortor and shrunk it to 20% of its size. I am using these to keep pests off my really good clothes between seasons. The quality for the price makes this a real value.	1
I bought this for my son and he really liked it. I was afraid he may have already bought 1 for himself and I thought, "Oh, good, then this will be mine!", but now it looks like I'll have to buy one for myself. It's good sized duffel too!	1
I am a great fan of Bitcoin and I am always happy when I find souvenirs related to Bitcoin. This is one of the greatest ones I have. It really looks like a cool Bitcoin.	1
I bought this phone because I got sick of all the fancy smart phones braking on me. I decided to go back to the basics. This thing is tough. It is practically unbreakable. I even dropped in water and it still works fine. My favorite thing about the item is the flashlight. I use it all the time and it is super bright. It is a basic phone that will live up to any challenge.	0
Does what it says it would do, which is great. Sure, it's annoying that we even need it, but the item works, so it doesn't matter right now if it's annoying or not that they changed their design. Great product, should be a little cheaper though, considering what it does.	0
This tea tastes as good as it smells. Just enough amount of cinnamon and a great blend of apple and cinnamon. Definitely recommended.	1
Exactly what I wanted. It's spacious inside and really don't take up much space on the door, fit neatly in place. Note to the manufacturer, please do a better finishing job at the corners. Made in America should be excellent...I will recommend this product.	1
I had the same experience, bought four bags of the Tegra-lite and after one trip it looks awful.<br />I've called customer service and they are giving me instructions to return. I thought this stuff was supposed to be bulletproof but it looks disgusting after one trip!! Dance all over the bags and some of the vinyl looks like it's peeling off.	0
As soon as I got this watch through FedEx and when I view the watch online I fell in love with it because it was cheap, it has two clocks, it has the time zones, and I can turn on and off the DST. On a scale of 1 to 1,000 I love this watch 1,000%.	1
after a black and decker 20v unit I bought this product with some reservation assuming that if I didn't like it I could always send it back.  this one is definatly a keeper.  what a difference 20 more volts makes in a tool, this trimmer can easily cu through the thickest of grass with ease and was cheeper than the stihl version.  unlike other reviewers I have had no problems with the line feed yet and get a good hour out of the battery.  this unit lasts long enough to do my entire acre or so yard with ease.  if your thinking about it, stop and give this unit a shot.	0
Attaches to other suitcases and rolls awesome. Makes traveling threw an airport a breeze. Also held up threw the baggage handlers. Saved and kept the carseat clean.	1
What else can I say? It was a chick flick. But I did like it. I like Sandra Bullock also, she is great in any movie!	0
I enjoyed each and every one of these stories. Ron Rash has a way with words and his stories are interesting, intriguing and often surprising.<br /><br />In The Trusty, a prisoner gets loose and with the help of a woman he sees his way to freedom only to have things turn on him in the end.<br /><br />In Cherokee, Danny goes to a casino hoping to win enough money to pay off his debt. He and his wife check in to the hotel and Danny carefully plays the slot machines.<br /><br />A man who considers himself a 'Servant of History' looks into the etiology of songs. His search for these beginnings ends up turning around and harming him.<br /><br />Those Who Are Dead Are Only Now Forgiven was one of my favorite stories in the collection. A college student is in love with Lauren who has turned into a meth-head. He tries to free her from her addiction but ends up giving himself to her and her demons.<br /><br />The Dowry is another of my favorites. A family is totally against the marriage of their daughter and is about to kill her fiance when a pastor steps in to make things right and evens up the score.<br /><br />All of the stories have panache and I read them aloud to my husband as we were driving. It was great to hear the words spoken and to share the book with someone else. It is a welcome addition to Rash's repertoire of works and I plan to read his other short stories soon. For those of you who enjoyed 'Serena', these stories will not be disappointing.	0
No wonder it was cheaper here. Its a defective product...the basket wood was stained green instead of espresso... very disappointing!!! Wasn't even as described in title of product...although other than the color it was perfect...	1
Not long ago I flew off to the United Kingdom to spend several weeks with my daughter and granddaughter.  Before I left I spent weeks shopping for luggage, packing & repacking, checklists in hand.  And then I read the fine print on the luggage allowances . . . .<br /><br />It used to be that you could set the suitcase on the bathroom scale, but flat scales and wheels on the suitcase have done away with all that, so five days before I was due to catch the plane I realized that I had to do something to weigh the suitcases.  Going over your allowed number of pounds by even a single pound can be quite expensive.  This [[ASIN:B004EZG9X4 EatSmart Precision Voyager Digital Luggage Scale w/ 110 lb. Capacity & SmartGrip]] was the answer!<br /><br />This is easy as pie to use:  unhook the catch, wrap the straps around the handle of your suitcase, clip the strap shut, push the on button, wait until you see zeros and then lift the piece of luggage off the floor by the handle.  The weight displays in seconds.  Since you use two hands, I had no problem with my smaller carry-on.  I did have to corral my son-in-law to weigh the larger as I am too short to get the thing off the ground.  (I could probably pack myself in that suitcase without too much discomfort LOL.)<br /><br />The directions suggest that you underpack by a pound, then stash the scale in your suitcase.  I simply threw it in my pocketbook, where it took up only a minimal amount of space.  SO much easier than messing around with the bathroom scale trying to balance the suitcase!<br /><br />Recommended	0
We enjoyed this so much on our king mattress that I ordered one for our guest bedroom.  This is an amazing mattress for the price, you just can't beat it.  I was tempted to spend much more on a memory foam mattress, but glad I saved my money on this instead.  Very easy to assemble and when you see the box it comes in, its hard to believe theres a mattress set in it.	0
super easy to use and accurate! it was also very easy to set up. i did a test comparison with a regular BP cuff, lying and sitting, and each arm and the results were almost identical. i've been using the setting that averages 3 readings over a 6min time frame and been pleased- maybe because it showed that my pressure was actually lower than i'd feared or lower than it is when i have it taken in the doctors office-i must have true &#34;white coat syndrome&#34;!	0
Great idea but very poorly executed.<br />We loved the idea of playing Giant Jenga in our backyard but this is not satisfactory.<br />Yeah, the size is ok but it's not really that big.<br />Note this game does not include a storage bag so it's got nowhere to go once it's unpacked.<br />I have now bought another far superior item.	1
I live in a house with 5 other housemates. For over a year I was constantly losing mail because we simply had one tray for everyone's mail. About six months ago I bought this and used a label maker to mark everyone's individual slot. This thing is a lifesaver.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1) The piece itself is very sturdy and well put together. I know this is built to hold paper, so I know I don't have to worry about it falling apart on me.<br /><br />2) There are wooden pockets on both sides that can hold pens, blank envelopes, whatever else you need to put in it.<br /><br />3) There are plenty of hooks to put our keys. We have a mailbox that requires a key to open it and before we got this mailbox we were constantly losing the key for it. Now we are able to keep the mailbox key on a hook and it hasn't gotten lost once since I purchased this mail organizer.<br /><br />4) The very bottom slot is rather large and extends out past the other slots. It is PERFECT for large things that come in the mail (weekly grocery fliers, store magazines, food coupons, etc.).<br /><br />5) The slots can be made larger than what is pictured. The vertical pieces you are seeing that divide the trays into 8 mail slots can be removed. If you do not need all the slots show and desire a larger slot, that can be easily done.<br /><br />CONS<br />1) The slots are a lot smaller than I would have liked. I made the mistake of not checking the dimensions. The slots are not long enough to hold a normal size envelope. The envelope extends about 2 inches out past the end of the shelf. If you decide to label the slots, this makes it very hard to read or even see the labels.<br /><br />2) If a letter comes in the mail that isn't as long as a normal letter, but is taller than a normal letter, then the piece of mail has to be slightly folded in order to get inside the slot. Luckily (for me at least), those pieces of mail are usually junk mail and are not as important.<br /><br />3) The pieces that are used asdividers between slots are very flimsy. The piece as a whole is very well put together and sturdy, but these pieces are not as reliable. However, I have not had issues with any of them as of yet.	0
Last year I bought a set & they do keep veggies & fruits fresh for a long time & I do save money. I bought this new set b/c the rectangular containers were presented to hold more but they don't so I returned them. The Presenter seldom closes a lid & that's b/c you can't fit much in them especially large Bell Peppers, lettuce, a normal bag of spinach etc. It's only my husband & I so it's not like I'm trying to store food for an army.	1
Finally got one amazing battery powered light,with a sensor that works always. Love them. I use one in my closet.This makes me to see clearly what's hiding in there! I have another one in a deep corner of my kitchen cabinets where I store pans and other kitchen things. The lights comes on when I open the cabinet door allowing me to see the pans! No more digging! I have recommend to my friends.	1
This big guy is truly a gem for the travelers. Amazingly crafted, this bag offers so much of space that you could literally fit a cow in it. I seem to fit everything I might need while I travel and still have room for more. The outer pockets are very handy and can also hold quite a few things. I've taking this guy to many places and it was a wonderful experience to use it. This was my second buy from the great Ecocraftworld and they have yet again surprised me with their outstanding quality. Hats off to them…	1
Bought Sphero for my kids and we've been having a blast with it ever since. Pretty cool little robot that has a bunch of different gaming apps. Read the other reviews here and it seems like people either love it or hate it. We love it.	1
You should be aware that this stuff is sticky on both sides.  I used it like regular caulk for an outside gap around a replacement window, and after a month in the elements (somewhat protected by an overhang) it's actually held up very nicely without attracting a lot of dirt or trapping bugs.  I would call the color a medium tone gray.  Fairly rubbery so you want a sharp knife to cut it, but very easy to stick in place using just fingers.  Good adhesion, good quality material.  I couldn't get as smooth a look as with regular caulk, but I was applying it at an awkward angle over my head.  Certainly it was much quicker and easier than using a caulk gun.  No volatile fumes, no messy clean up.  All told, I'm very happy with the results I achieved.	0
This is a great kit to use to remove your blackheads on your nose. It works perfectly, and it is what they used to remove your blackheads professionally! It is worth the buy, and I am very satisfied with my purchase, and my nose is now clear of blackheads after usage of this remover kit :).	1
This has become a beloved nerf toy in our home. I'm happy that the can play fight with something soft!	0
This wax is great!<br /><br />It holds strong but you can still style it throughout the day. It doesn't leave the white flakes like hairspray does.	1
This is unbelievable. I can't believe this worked so well where as the rest of the supplements I've had, even shampoos that specializes on thickening hair, didn't work at all.	1
Book reading is my thing so I read a lot of books. But I strangely disagree to the writer of this book since it conflicts with other writers I believed for years. But over all its good composition for knowledge.	1
I own the Apple TV.  I like it, but it started giving me grief recently while downloading movies (slowwwww buffering).  I decided I would give Roku a try, and boy am I glad I did!  I love this little box.  Admittedly, I only use maybe 3-4 channels, but I primarily bought it for Netflix anyway.  That said, the real star of the show (for me, anyway) is Plex!  I love this software!  I have all my movies on a 2 TB hard drive on my 'Plex server' (home PC).  I then use the Plex app on my Roku to watch movies from my bedroom.  It's awesome!  The Plex app serves up all of my movies in a Netflix-like interface, with tiles for each movie or TV show.  Zero regrets for this purchase!  I was a little worried after buying a Roku 2 that the interface would be slow compared to the Roku 3, but it's just great!  And I am an impatient person!  Anyway, I just wanted to share.	0
Great price and works great with my Canon 7D.  Products looks and feel strong. I highly recommend this product. I love it!	1
Not one of their best movie but still watched it a little because its DC and thier cartoon are usually really good but I gets they wanted to gg a little old school with this one like super friends	1
The description doesn't match the product (doesn't that always seem to happen?). I ordered this over a month ago and I JUST got it in the mail. Not to mention it's only 85 inches long when it was advertised 103 inches. I got it and it doesn't even fit my bike. And now I'm going to have to buy another one. What a waste of $30.	1
These will not compare to a pair of $300 plus Sennheisers or DRE Sennheisers http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B008BXB76Y DRE Phones http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00E9262IE  As far as THESE headphones. They are a great set of headphones overall and will not disappoint you. http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK  Cons - My biggest con with this headphone is - not only I can hear the music but also everyone sitting around me, even if they are at a distance of 15 feet. There are no sound proof systems with this headphone and thus there is lot of leakage in the audio. So it seriously becomes a speaker instead of a headphone at volumes just at two bars.  Pros + Looks sturdy, although it is made of plastic. It fits well for someone with a smaller head as it fits really tight so that it doesn't slip from your head (happens when you are doing a workout or so enthusiastically shaking your head for your favorite song). Prolonged usage caused a little soreness over the ears. The head band is adjustable.  + Easily pairs up with any device. I was able to pair it with both my computer (mac air) and my iphone. Once pairing is done with all the devices, you can connect to two of them simultaneously. Although, there were certain issues when I was in a microsoft lync meeting. The microphone was connected in mono mode and hence people hear muffled voices from me.  + Most important - the sound quality. The first impression was not great and I decided to actually return the product. But, I experimented with more good quality audio with deep bass, techno, melody, etc... The SOUND IS NOT THAT GREAT. Don't expect bass from this headphone. But it is decent enough with the sound quality that you won't repent your purchase.  + Volume - This is seriously loud even with the lowest volume level in your device as well as the headphones. BASS very low.  + Functionality with phone - It works well both with the mic and the sound. Problem occurs only when you are connected in mono mode andnot stereo mode (I use this terminology as shown in my mac air for this headphone). While in mono mode, people hear your muffled voice and you hear back nothing. If you are connecting to more than two devices and one of them is your phone, connect to your phone first and then to the other device next.  + Charge - This headphone retains pretty good charge. Its been 4 days since I charged it and I use it at least for 3 hrs everyday. The iphone also shows how much charge is left on the headphones.  Overall, this is a good headphone if you are not looking for something too good for music listening. You will not regret your purchase and will be happy you checked out http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00UN5Z1BK	1
My son is 3 years old and it's real easy for him to put on and take off his shoes independently. He wore it to Disney and did great not complains of pain :)	0
Very nice！Excellent flashlight. Very powerful. best flashlight you can buy for the money!!! I would get it again and probably will,  you can have a flashlight with a strobe, brighter then most stingers ($200 flashlights).	1
I was quite disappointed with this product.<br /><br />With the filters I was hoping that clean up would be easier than my [[ASIN:B0064A7SRS Ekobrew Cup,Refillable K-Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers 2-Pack - BROWN $ GREEN]].  -- Alas it was not.<br /><br />This Melitta system also does not hold as much grounds as the Ekobrew --  it is a very small amount however makes a BIG difference in the taste / strength of the coffee.  So I suspect it is both the amount of grounds the cup holds as well as the Ekobrew being able to extract more flavor due to  how water passes through the grounds.<br /><br />I also like the Ekobrew better because it is 100% reusable.  This Melitta system while initially a lot less money does use disposable filters which add to extra cost.<br /><br />While the Ekobrew costs a bit upfront it is worth it.  I have an Ekobrew for over a year and have had no problem with it (note I have about a 12 and use 2-3 every day).  Even with heavy daily use they all still have held up well.	0
Both cases I got cracked in the same spot above the camera. Since the case is like paper thin it doesn't withstand any sort of impact.	1
It plays my dvds and blu rays! Exactly what I needed at a nice price considering my two years watches more on it then I ever will. I have not tried the apps but admittedly I have no interest in them, I just needed it to do one job play movies. It does it's job so I'm very happy!	0
Good Camera Bag for DSLR Camera's, all size fit and it has kushan wrapped around to protect from minor damages, and hard board at bottom. order the second one	1
It looks beautiful and seems perfect for a woman like me who holds too much accessories. The color is gorgeous, I love how they colored it up. So many compartments which is what I like most and that lock feature for the top and side part is genius. I also love how they maximise the space it have, like the side compartment for necklaces, it have this small pockets at the bottom and still have hangers. Downside was, the box I received have some flaws and I blame the Quality Control inspector here. Some of the hangers are not properly attached, they are somewhat loose. The inside compartment of one of the drawers isn't aligned properly like the others so it has this uneven area. Mirror isn't clean when I opened it, I don't know how it happened. Next time, I hope they inspect these kind of things first before sending it to their buyers.	1
Quality wax. My wife's red Chevy looks very good after using this wax on it. It is also very resistant and doesn't fo off after the first couple of washes. Recommended	1
i like hiking,and i like different kind of waist pack,when i choose this funny pack,i think it looks nice and easy to carry.when i got it ,i realized i got what i need,just as description:waterproof and the pocket large enough to hold cellphone and purse,bottle holder also great,perfect to hold my bottle,i love the nice pack	1

i have this stool in my mini office. i use it when at the desk (not so often) but i like that it swivels so i can turn and pick up a guitar or play my keyboard. easy to put together.	0
I love all Texans office supplies but I must say... The helmet is lighter than I expected. I have to hold it with both hands to use it so I can't multitask when I need tape.	0
I definitely got a fake product. I've used nioxin before and it was OK. Did not gain any hair, but did not lose any hair either. I ordered this here off amazon and not only does it smell different then the stuff I had before, but its made my hair shed like crazy. I returned it asap and had a long talk with an amazon representative. Unfortunately without more complaints, they won't look into if this is a fake product or not. Save yourself the trouble...	1
We are located on the ICW, Intra Coastal Waterway, and use the Binoculars to view boats traveling north and south on the waterway. I previously bought a pair of the 12x36 IS and love them. We are close enough to the waterway to sometimes read where the various boats are from. When there are several people visiting the one pair was not enough so I thought I would order an addtional pair that were more powerful. I was expecting more from the 18x50's. They are much larger and heavier. If you got a significant boost in magnification that would be fine, but I see very little increase in magnification. Only a loss of field of vision. I should have ordered another pair of the 12x36's.	0
Farberware BBQ Instant Read Thermometer with Large Digital Face, by Farberware.<br />When I received this thermometer from Amazon, I was a bit disappointed. It is 1 ¼" wide and 5" long. I already have one of these small ones that are more difficult to read as I get older. The write-up on this BBQ thermometer gave the impression that it was larger.  The product description said that it would be 10" long. This is false advertising by Amazon, and one reason that I hate to buy things from a catalog. If it is broken or not as advertised, you have to go through the headache of returning it through the mail. At least if you buy something in an old style brick and mortar store, you can go there and return it more easily. In the same shipment, I also received from Amazon a broken Salter kitchen scale that was made of cheap plastic with chrome paint. The description of that item gave the impression that it was chrome covered metal, not plastic.  More false or misleading advertising by Amazon.  I give up. I will shop at a local kitchen store instead, where I can see what I am getting, and can evaluate the product in the store. Fortunately, I can still drive a car and I do not have to depend on catalogs. The one good thing that I can say about this product, is that it gave exactly the same temperature reading as the one I already had.<br /><br />Farberware Products, c/o Lifetime Brands, Inc., Customer Service Department, P.O.

I'm a grandparent and I needed to protect some cabinets from my visiting granddaughter, but I hate those hook type catches because you have to deal with them forever or until you remove them.  These magnetic hooks have an ON/OFF feature that makes them perfect for the occasional visits.  Installation is made relatively easy by the template with double sided sticky tape that allows you to properly locate the latch and the catch.  My only complaint is the stick tape isn't sticky enough and the template has a tendency to come off too easily.	0
I bought one of these for my 8 year old son. He loves pokemon a lot so I think that this will be a perfect gift for him.	1
What a great armband. Just got it and it is so lightweight and comfortable. Love the extra feature of key keeper.	1
This background was smaller for the shoot than I was thinking it was going to be but overall it worked out great. The material is very soft and the print looks good. To remedy the problem we placed a 10x20 black backdrop behind this one and it looked as if my wife was pretty far in front of the wall and it made a corner into a darker room. Raising it up high enough for a standing person brought the floor up higher but due to the prop behind my wife it did make it look as if the wall was further back.	0
The cam is attractive, produces exclusive output. The cam provides bright videos, I gate much clear video at dim light. Total configuration of this cam is sufficient, very easy to configure. Sound quality is very much clear. Infrared at night is really great.	1
An excellent Deal! Shipping was quick! Needed protection for my eyes. Very Comfortable to wear out side the warzone! They rarely fog up when in the moment.  Clear and very protective of your eyes!  Would recommend!  Thanks once again!  Tested with paint balls survived a few hits but would not recommend it for that type of activity.	1
I have finished on bottle and now I am coming for more. The 3 bottles bundle has a very affordable price.	1
There are times when I want to use one of my presses for all stages of the process. Other times I need a handheld like the Lee Auto Prime. It is fast, accurate in its depth control and safe if used as directed. This priming tool is indispensable for my reloading needs.	0
I used these glasses for walking and softball. They were very comfortable and fit well even when running to the bases. I noticed that there were no smudges on the lens even after sweating and from the sunscreen.	1
This is the best plug in and go , you can get endless fun from movies ,sky sports or any sport that you can imagine. My mates at work just don't believe me , but its true. The only complaint is the size, a little bit small for me, but it's much more lightweight and easy to carry. Happy with everything.	1
This was great. Why did the producers pull this one? Some of the series are just stupid but others like this one are really compelling.	0
those flavor drops really are great and very easy to mix.my kids want me to give me their medicine now	1
Joe Rogan spent money on testing Dave Asprey's claims about myotoxins being in 70% of coffee in the United States.<br /><br />What did that result in?<br /><br />Change of advertisement (Above):<br /><br />Low in mycotoxins<br />Mechanically Processed<br />Small batch roasted by the #1 roaster in the United States<br /><br />--<br /><br />Avoid this overpriced coffee.

Nothing fancy but it is a good price and it is a sturdy little unit for the right size tv. This was purchased for my daughter's dorm room tv. Fits great.	1

doesn't feel like leather, cheaply made I bought as a gift but didn't bother giving it to her for I knew it would not last.	0
I didn't know about this at first .I just can't believe how detailed the facts are. If you are a JFK fan it is a book (books)for you .They will make great gifts for the enthusiast and  awsome table top books.	1
The color shades are true to form but mine was more red on it. I love it anyway. Picks up sunlight wonderfully!I am very happy that I bought it.	1
Got these for a stocking stuffer for my brother. He is always loosing his picks or breaking them and I loved that this was a package is 60! Hopefully they will last him awhile! These picks look great and are nice in color and quality of materials. Would purchase again.	1
It did not work well at all, will not try again, messed up the screen and had a hard job getting it clean.	0
I was so pleasantly surprised to find this excellent kit at the offered price! It came fast and I'm already using it, half on my scanner, half in my camera bag.	0
This car seat cover works great!  It is made from a material that, at least for my dog, is easy to brush off his dog hair and keep clean looking.  Most importantly it keeps my back seat clean.  Easy to install and stays in place without slipping.  I would recommend this product.	0
I received it on time and as per instructions used it for about 3 days and so far the only changes I've sen are a slight increase of roaches, though the instructions say that this will happen since these rodents will all come out and try to move away from the plug. I'l give it a few more weeks to see if it really gets them all out.	1
Do yourself a favor and buy these teas in the cold-brewed form. The flavor is fresher and the cost is not as prohibitive. The cold-brewed bags can be popped right into your water bottle, add cold water and ice and it's ready to drink in a couple of minutes. Keurig brewers are fantastic for coffee but do not produce the best tea. All flavors can be found at IHerb.com for $3.31 a box of 20. Especially like the pom-raspberry and the citrus splash -- peach is also great.	0
Let's see...plugged it into my N64 and my 47" TV. It gets the signal to the TV just fine and looks as good as my N64 always did on the CRT screen it used to connect to. Hasn't broken, but then again I never move the system.	0
This was my first taste of Spirulina and it is very tasty.  This bar is great as a snack, or for breakfast with an energy drink.  It has just enough calories that with a drink it can serve as a meal replacement and is full of nutrition.  Recommend it for anyone new to Spirulina cause I have tried other Spirulina bars that are not as novice friendly.	0
I don't have a way to measure the foil lamination but when I got these bags I can open one up and put it in front of my face to try and look out through the inside of the bag and see clear enough to walk around without bumping into anything.  I have other mylar bags from the place I got my freeze dryer from and they feel much thicker and you can't see through them; completely dark.<br /><br />Should I be able to see through the aluminum foil layer?	0
I am impressed with the built quality and the colors of each replacement rubber bands, they're working great without any issues. I highly recommend this set of replacement bands, they're worth the penny.	1
Using this tablet for school and class purposes and I have to say I'm not disappointed in my purchase, originally wanted an iPad but the price was just too much for me. With this device I can run excel sheets and browse the web all while running a bunch of programs in the background.	0
12 days after putting it up hose broke by the head, the head fell off and water went every where. Hose was thin and junk where it goes on head. Save your time and money. Mine went in trash, good place for it. Then went to Wal-Mart, and i don't like that place.	0
This collar saved my dog. After tons of research, watching videos, reading reviews, and checking consumer sites I decided to buy Oternal electric no bark collar.This collar is such a miracle worker. Pnut doesn't even bark anymore unless she wants to communicate with other dogs when we go on our walks and hikes. I still put the collar on her when I leave the dorm apartment just in case but it really is just a training tool.this collar is just amazing. It's worth the money investment. I barely use it and the battery is still full after 3 weeks. I would recommend this collar for anyone who wants to keep their dog. This is the miracle collar and works great even on small dogs like my pnut she is a pomchi  weighs about 8 lbs. The collar isn't too heavy for her. She is able to eat, drink, jump on her bed, and function with it on when I'm not home. I do know that my neighbors haven't complained since I have gotten this and they actually like her now and say Hi to me in the hallways instead of giving me dirty looks before I got this collar.	1
I really like this projector and would recommend it for this price range.<br /><br />I am using this in my living room for personal home theater, We have truly loved having this great projector in our home. Movie nights have become so much more fun now...<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Picture is fairly clear and crisp and easy to focus.<br />2. Set up was quite simple, many great interfaces to connect with my devices.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Buit-in speakers were not good enough like all other projectors. But that's fine, I can just mute the projector speakers by pressing the &#34;mute&#34; botton on the remote control and use my surround sound systems.<br /><br />In summary, worth buying for this price range!	1
These containers are awesome . I have has them for over 23 years now and still great .The are well made and work out great for me I love the color and the different sizes they come in . The top seals closed great and the food inside stays nice and fresh . These would make a great gift . I recommend this item.The product was package well.<br /><br />* This item was purchased *	1
i am using this for utvs so it is overkill in size but it is greaseable and heavy great product so far.	0
I read this book off of a friend's table once and she let me borrow it. I have to say that while there are some good points in this book I disagree with much of what is being encouraged here. To even consider them is disgusting to me and I have three wonderful, responsible and loving children who I've never had to treat the way this book advocates.	1
After searching store to store, I opted for this TV because it was the best value. Had it for about 2 weeks and I must admit that it has proved itself to be a great purchase. The sound is really loud with a little bassy which I like. No need for a sound bar. The picture is really huge and the HD is spot on. The colors are bright and the only problem I have is when I watch stream crackle movies through my Xbox.	1
I used the entire system in my fish boat to create customizable fishing stations.  The concept works great and once you have the track mounted you can really customize with anything you want.  I have cup holders, rod holders, pliars mounts, and fish finders mounted on this.  It works very well and handy to have.	1
*** Updated Review:  Be Aware of Roast Date to avoid older roast date Beans.  Coffee Beans are to be enjoyed when they are fresh roasted.  They are a perishable product that can go stale.    I have been subscribing to this product, and have often being sent older stored roasted date beans.  Fresh roasted coffee beans reach their "peak" at about 2 weeks after roasting, and diminish from there.  My last shipment was 3 month old beans under my 'Subscribe and Save'.  The original beans are quite good, but no longer being 'fresh roasted' by the time I receive them was disappointing   I had to discontinue the Subscribe and Save as a result of this...    How to read a Coffee Bean Direct Date Code at the bottom of 5lb bag:  First off, the "Expiration Date" is exactly 1 year from the Roast/Packing Date.    Second, the date code is written as such: (example) "26714.02 "  EQUALS "267"th day of year (20)"14" . batch "02".  267th day of year is Sept 24th; 14 is year 2014; .02 is 2nd batch of day....    Being sent 3 month old beans is the fault of warehouse inventory control.  I believe the vendor does freshly pack his beans, and sends to Amazon warehouse.  Then Amazon stockpiles it into warehouse storage, and ships out older stockpiles...  I really want freshest roast date product, so I have to again change vendor sources...    **** Original Review***  I have been using Malabar Monsooned beans for about 8 Years, and I am glad to have this new source to choose from.  I feel that monsooned malabar is optimal for Cappuccinos, as its smoothness complements micro-foamed milk quite well.  My first pull from this new order had a very nice crema, dark golden colored as hoped for and expected. Smooth and rich.  City Roasted, roasted till the first crack and allowed to rest before finishing, had the characteristics I wanted, not too darkly roasted...  So for people who want to grind their beans via a burr grinder, and pull a golden shot via their dialed in espresso machine, I can recommend this.  I don't use this for drip coffee, so I can't comment on that, but this makes a pretty good cappuccino via my Gaggia Classic.  4.25 Stars	0
It's a great item. The price is right. Fits perfectly. And with the red color I can always find my keys.	0
It will do the job. I do wish that it looked a little more stylish though, but many of the ones that fit that profiles ended up being useless lumps of plastic or steel.	1
Instead of dumping one or two type of chili powder into your home-made chili, try substituting some of these instead. You'll get a much more complex seasoning.<br />If the recipe calls for, say 1 tablespoon of chili powder (which is 3 teaspoons total), try using 1 teaspoon Pasilla, 1 teaspoon Guajillo and 1 teaspoon New Mexico chilis. The difference is amazing.<br />Even if you're a student on a budget using store-brand canned chili, adding these to it will really change it into something you look forward to.<br />These also work great for home-made ground beef burritos. Brown 1 pound of beef with maybe some onions & bell peppers, add some tomato sauce and a mix of 2-3 teaspoons of these spices and simmer until it thickens. You're done in 30 minutes and the result is better than anything you could buy, plus it will provide more than one meal.	0
I held off purchasing this mouse because I was skeptical that a 40 dollar mouse could sway me not to buy a razer or a steel series gaming mouse. I was wrong. This mouse is hassle free. Extremely comfortable. Easy to use and set up. The software is simple even for non gamers to set up and manage. The clicks sound and feel great. The tracking is superb. The adjustable weights are perfect. There is nothing I can say bad about this mouse. If you are looking for a gaming mouse with out al the bugs or the high price? Get this one! You will NOT be sorry! Been using it for over a month now and I game hard with it. Shooters, mmorpg's, stratedy games, you name it. Cant make this mouse lag out or miss a shot and the easy to click dpi helps you zero in on your selected/intended target very easily. Buy with confidence that it will last you a very long time and that you will be able to use it for any application. Oh....one more thing...I have not found a surface that this mouse wont track on. I even stuck it on my head with all the hair and it still didnt miss a beat lol. BUY IT!	1
This tube saved me a lot of hassle bathing my newborn. When I was a new mom, I was terrified when it came to bathing infant the first week that baby came home. Thank goodness for this tube design!	1
Did not work nearly as well as I thought it would. I used a screw driver and a stripped screw for this product and I let it sit for hours on end yet the JB Weld came off my screwdriver way too easily.	1
GORGEOUS!  This is a high quality bag that is large enough to use as a diaper bag if you so choose, but small enough to be an every day carry purse.  The first thing I generally look at is the seams.  Are they high quality or single stitching.. these are definitely high quality stiched seams.  There are no frays, it is beautiful.  It can be used as a shoulder bag, or you can carry simply with the 2 carry handles.  The bag comes with the additional strap to be added for shoulder carry.  The inside of the purse has 2 large sections, separated by a full size zippered pocket center.  There is a zippered pocket on the outside and inside along the shell, and 2 pockets on the opposite inside.  It is genuine leather, and you can tell that as soon as you open the package.  It just smells of that wonderful new leather scent.  A very nice bag in every way, even down to  the small details and embellishments.  I am in love.	1
he is so graet' becuse he simplly makes your life so easy.<br />this key holder is very strong and very paractical. this is one of my best buying on amazon.	0
I have always been a believer of Camelbak water bottles. They never leak and literally last me years. Much better for environment than continuously using a new plastic Aquafina bottle each time.	1
***SPOILER ALERT*** The least said about &#34;The Crying Game&#34; the better. Not that it has any serious problems. Far from it. This offbeat emotional thriller is an unusually satisfying film, intricately constructed, surely directed and splendidly acted. But because this is something different, a sophisticated entertainment where the ground is constantly shifting under your feet, too much knowledge can be a dangerous thing. &#34;Crying Game's&#34; writer-director is Neil Jordan. Jordan's record since has been erratic, particularly where forays into Hollywood are concerned, but with this film he returns to Ireland and displays the kind of modulated but exact mastery of his material that is a model of directorial purpose and execution. Even more impressive than his work behind the camera is Jordan's script, which manages to combine spontaneity of action with the most careful planning. While &#34;The Crying Game's&#34; plot unfolds with complete naturalness and ease, there is nothing casual about the way it was put together. Even its most unstudied moments and off-handed remarks almost magically come together and resonate with a precise purpose that only becomes apparent as the film progresses. &#34;The Crying Game&#34; deals with unlikely relationships and unusual pairings. Its title comes from a 1960s romantic ballad whose lyric insists &#34;I know what there is to know about the crying game.&#34; The film's characters, however, are less secure in their emotional knowledge, and when one of them says, with a measure of irony, &#34;Who knows the mysteries of the human heart?&#34; he is speaking for everyone. &#34;The Crying Game&#34; (Edwards South Coast Plaza Village in Costa Mesa, rated R for sexuality, strong violence and language) opens at a ragtag local carnival in Northern Ireland. Lurching around its scruffy rides and attractions is Jody (Forest Whitaker), a black British army sergeant way off duty, who finds himself very drunkenly attracted to Jude (MirandaRichardson), a blond, tarty type in a tight denim skirt. Jude lures him to a deserted spot with promises of hanky-panky, but no sooner do they get comfortable than a pistol appears at Jody's head. Adroitly set up, he now finds himself kidnaped by the Irish Republican Army in retaliation for the British capture of an IRA stalwart. Unless the British let their man go in three days, Jody is told by Maguire (Adrian Dunbar), the IRA will put a bullet in his head. With that head covered by a stifling burlap sack and his hands pinioned behind him, Jody is shuffled off to a deserted greenhouse, where Fergus (Stephen Rea), an IRA soldier who has designs of his own on Jude, is assigned to guard him. Alone together, Fergus and Jody warily exchange names and, despite the odd intimacy of their situation, with Fergus having to not only feed Jody but also help him with more private activities, they slowly begin to warm to each other. Talk is exchanged about sports, about Ireland, about racism, even about the event that brought them together. Jude, Jody says laughing now about his blowzy blond seductress, isn't even my type. From the soldier's wallet, Fergus fishes out a picture of the darkly beautiful, long-haired Dil (Jaye Davidson), a model-thin knockout who is the prisoner's London girlfriend. &#34;Now that's my type,&#34; says Jody with satisfaction, and Fergus can only nod in appreciation. Though Jody is the captive and Fergus nominally his captor, Jordan and his adroit actors have made their interaction seem nowhere near that simple. Jody seems curiously confident, Fergus unsure, and something unknown seems to hang in the air just out of reach as a kind of brotherhood takes shape between them. This undefined sense of things being not quite what they seem continues to be the keynote of &#34;The Crying Game,&#34; a picture that has the delicious ability of never letting on at any given moment what the next one will bring. The interaction of Jody, Fergus and Jude, not to mention Dil, does not end in that greenhouse, but aside from noting that nothing about how it develops is either predictable or false, all the rest must be left to the film itself to disclose. Making that process thoroughly entertaining is the skill of the actors involved. Whitaker, has a self-confident warmth and a Cockney accent even Michael Caine would approve of. And Rea, a celebrated stage actor; the versatile Richardson, and newcomer Jaye Davidson are all right on the money as well. Suspenseful and emotionally complex, skillfully mixing politics with affairs of the heart, &#34;The Crying Game&#34; is something unexpected, a challenging new way to tell a very old story. When Fergus says, &#34;Funny the way things go, never the way you expect them,&#34; he is speaking for the audience as well as himself, and that is a cause not for crying but for celebration.	0
item delivered is a knockoff version of the one listed.  it seems to work as described, but isn't particularly awesome.<br /><br />it only has 2 usb ports, rather than the 3 I was expecting, rendering it useless for what I wanted to do with it	0
Everyone saying this movie sucked clealyndoean't know a good movie. Thjs movie was great. Awesome story line, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Great great movie!	0
Great purchase, The keypad makes searching for Youtube videos and making signs in easier than before, nice to have one, as for the headset, it is also good.	1
Excellent cooler for the price. You cannot go wrong with this thing. Also has wheels which is great, and the spacing inside is very much enough.	1
These English Muffins are hard to find in stores, but recently a supermarket near us had them.  My son has a wheat allergy and loves these.  I don't have a wheat allergy and love them even more.  Hands down the best English Muffin on the market for my tastes.  Let it defrost a few minutes than cut it in half (they're cut already but not all the way through).  Butter it lightly and put it in the toaster over for maybe 3-4 minutes until it starts to lightly brown.  Then I like to add some strawberry jam or another flavor.  Delicious!  To market these only to gluten free people is a mistake.  And they need to get them in more stores more frequently.	0
The rug is quite attractive, with just the right amount of glitter. A rug pad is a necessity! The only downside is that it does a bit of shedding; pieces come off here and there. I do not have it in a high traffic area. Mine is secured under a loveseat. I purchased the gray, thinking it was a dove gray. It is almost black.	1
[[VIDEOID:8fe5fcba5508be458947060a02ccea99]] As we only received this carrier yesterday, we haven't had time to test it on our cat. It had to be assembled, and apart from some rudimentary instructions on the label, there were no directions to show us clearly how to put it together. However, this only took a few minutes. On unpacking, my initial feeling was that it looked rather flimsy, but now that it is assembled, it seems a neat,sturdy and well-designed pet carrier. Our previous carrier was not well put-together, and it was always a struggle to get our cat installed. I wanted one which would make travelling to the vet or to the cattery as stress-free for her as possible, and this one ticks all the boxes.	1
Size is much too small. Not a fan of photos in listings that misrepresent the sizes of the products.	1
My complaint is that the plastic protector for the head of the razor did not fit properly and has now cracked. I taped it back together. The manufacturer needs to redesign it so it fits better.	1
I use this as my &#34;survival&#34; tool on all my hikes. It gives me great peace of mind knowing that I will be able to take care of myself if I get lost or stranded. Plus this company is based from right here in Portland Oregon! Doesn't get much more local than that!	1
Not as bright as original but still ok, but  Burned out after about a half hour, I guess that's why it was so cheap	0
I have never been a huge fan of coconut water until my friend recommended me to try out Cocozia and let me tell you, this is the real deal. I have tried several other brands of coconut water before but I must say, Cocozia really changed my opinion. Not only is it refreshing and tasty but it also comes in perfect packaging making it easy for me to toss in my gym bag on the way out the door. It is also 100% organic and Kosher which is a big deal to me. It also contains a natural abundance of potassium and magnesium, as well as other electrolytes. For anyone skeptical of trying out Cocozia I highly recommend you do - this is the best out there.	1
Software installation is not ideal: installs different software components in sequential parts but requests a computer reboot after each part; if you reboot after the first part then the rest of the software is not installed.	1

Like a lot of gamers, I was very impressed by the early footage from Epic Mickey and Warren Specter's enthusiasm for the project. However, upon playing it, I'm decidedly mixed.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />The game is visually beautiful, really pushing the Wii's graphical capabilities above and beyond. The cutscenes look incredible, like a real cartoon. The levels are absolutely brimming with visual treats - no boring fields of grass or carbon copies of the same building repeated over and over. Look closely and you'll spot some cool Mickey paraphernalia in some levels.<br /><br />Using old cartoon strips as settings for the 2-D levels is ingenious. It's too bad they don't go on longer and only serve as transitional levels.<br /><br />There is some replay value. There are a lot of pins, which might interest players who like collecting Disney pins in real life. More interesting are the unlockable cartoon reels and concept art.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />The gameplay. It just isn't that exciting. It seems the game was torn between appealing to kids and holding the interests of adult gamers. Epic Mickey was billed as a platformer, but the never reaches anything as exciting as the Mario games. There's some jumping, there are some decent moments, but it's mostly just fetch quests where you have to find an item for somebody. However, the fetch quests often seem forced as they come at random times from people who aren't well developed characters (there are exceptions - I liked Horace the Detective).<br /><br />Other reviewers have criticized the camera system and I do agree. It's not a deal breaker, but there are times when it refuses to give you a clear view of what you need to see.<br /><br />THE UGLY<br /><br />The game is too hard for kids, too easy for adults. I think this game would have benefitted greatly from allowing the user to adjust the difficult setting.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD<br /><br />At the end of the day, there's a lot of potential in Epic Mickey,but I can't really say it's a great game. It's probably one of the better third-party games for the Wii, but that's not saying a whole lot. I will probably try Epic Mickey 2 because Warren Specter seems aware of Epic Mickey's flaws, but I won't be rushing to get it on Day One.	0
It actually did not meet or expectations. During initial testing we ran into scenarios where water actually leaked into the case.  It was minimal but water none the less. Since I have stopped using.	0
Very sluggish. I am not impressed with this box because it freezes all the time. I boxed it up and sent it back it was so bad.	1
This speaker was supposed to just let us play some tunes while enjoying a day of fishing, but it performs even better than what I thought. The volume goes so high, people by the shore could hear it and they were probably 2 km away!	1
I love this Tallit bag. It is large so it plenty of room for my Tallit.<br /><br />The real bonus is all the zippered compartments, so I can keep my Kipot in a small pocket and then I have large section for my Tankh and amy other books, plus another small compartment for some sweets to help with dry mouth in long messages or study sessions.	0
This brought back so many great memories as a kid. I had to have it. Showed up on time, and does everything it list. Awesome for around the tree. yes u should buy 1 for the family. THANKS amazon!	1
There are already 156 reviews with one star. I see no point in repeating all the negatives about this piece of junk. This is a severely overpriced loser that has no on/off button, it has no wireless keyboard capability, the rinky dink remote has no subtitle button, every activity requires a credit card and numerous passwords and codes that must be entered with the dorky remote etc etc etc. I tried to provide feedback through their moronic survey form and that did not work either. Stay away from this disaster. Far, far away.	0
I like Ray Milland movies, but this movie is just plain crappy.  A bunch of frogs at a house do bad things.  Perhaps if Kermit was involved for a few laughs and some massive doses of gore and violence, it might make this better.  Better to sit in a dark room waiting for sunrise and watch your shadow move.  I once knew a man with a frog, he lived down by a bog, he woke up one day, said what the hay and blew  his pickled brains all away.	0
Bought this for our 7 foot Christmas tree and it was enough to cover the whole tree all the way around, and even had some left over. The ribbon was gorgeous!	0

If you like mysteries, histories, finances and analyses, business rights and wrongs, you will really enjoy this book.  It is fast-paced, the author has a personal stake in this story, which is really two stories, and the author's enjoyment and enthusiasm comes through when he pieces together his well-researched clues to tell the tale of his disappearing great-uncle and the history of his great-uncle's employer, the L.R. Steel Company.  Dyer found out where and when Great Uncle Clayton disappeared and reappeared but answers to the mystery of Clayton's behavior are most likely contained within the rapid rise and fall of the L. R. Steel Company and its founder, Leonard Rambler Steel.<br /><br />For history buffs, the book is filled with photos and articles mostly from the early 1920's.  It's also a microcosm of lessons-learned like the consequences of hubris and revenue-is-not-profit,  lessons that can and should be applied to all of us in our personal lives and to 21st century business practices.	0

This is so very close to being a blockbuster book. All the ingredients are there: thrills, romance, mysteries, religion, science, spirituality. But what's missing? Good editing and proofreading; the pacing and order are off and a few of the plot devices are not believable. I certainly stumbled with the air car, implant, and oh-so-holy roller government moles. On the other hand, I loved the sacred geometry, the trek to Tibet, and implications for the future of mankind. Add this to your reading list if you're the least bit interested in the intersection of science and spirituality (buoyed by the revolutionary physics of Nassim Haramein.)	0
From the time I was 14 until I turned 50 in 2000, I was a dedicated "film" camera nut. In 1990, I graduated to a serious Nikon film camera and two quality lenses, a standard zoom and a telephoto zoom. Reluctantly, as the digital chatter started to fill most camera club discussions and magazines, I started to experiment with two advanced digital point-and-shoot cameras with a minimum of 10X optical zooms... each for a period of 4 years. The die was cast at that point, and I sadly found a storage spot for my beloved film gear. The second of the point-and-shoots was the Canon PowerShot S5 IS with the articulating LCD screen. I cannot begin to tell you the value of an articulating digital LCD screen that allows you to capture an eye level image of a blossom without the need to sit on the ground to do so. Or, capture several hours worth of a full lunar eclipse with a tripod mounted camera at a nearly overhead celestial body. That tilted screen made the job easier and saved lots of neck pain. So, from 2009 through the end of January (2011), I labored over which DSLR/lens combinations would take my "mad money". Being a Nikon man carried the ball, but I wanted that articulating LCD screen. Like buying a car, sometimes the little things carry the day.<br /><br />On February 1, 2011, I became the proud owner of a Canon DSLR. I purchased the Canon 60D body and two Canon "L" lenses: the f4 24-105mm IS USM standard zoom and the f2.8L 70-200mm IS II USM telephoto zoom. Sure, the camera body was significant, but lens quality takes your images to the NEXT level. I was confident with the decision, and now after a month of serious practice with the 60D/lens combinations, I am getting VERY satisfying image quality...sharp or soft depending on the subject. Not only does the camera body have the necessary articulating LCD screen, it allows me as much control as I choose...from full auto to standard settings, to the zone where I live...aperature-priority and shutter-priority. Living along the Atlantic Flyway, February can be a challenging month weather-wise but the Canon 60D and the lenses proved to be up to the task, especially when the first and last hours of light give you some truly spectacular wildlife opportunities and remarkable sunrises and sunsets.<br /><br />Just know that I don't spend my money recklessly and I expect results when I put my money down. Without a doubt, this camera body passed the February test in all kinds of lighting and temperatures ranging from 15 degrees to 65 degrees. I did little here to address the 60D's specs, but I now know this camera is not a Rebel and it's not a 7D. The controls and advanced features truly put the 60D in its own niche. If you want the specs, check the review by dojoklo dated Sept. 20, 2010.<br /><br />Bottom line: This camera is a good fit for a sports enthusiast, a dedicated nature/landscape lover, and the individual with a vision of digitally capturing "gallery" quality images. You are IN CONTROL with the 60D in your hands.	1
it meet the expectisions, was good but it clound be better. in the some others way. but it not bad... jose  depina	0
My daughter started sucking her thumb immediately with this on.  It's just a thin piece of cloth that is almost like a normal thumb.  It didn't work for us but may for others.  Good luck!	0
We purchased a pair of these for our daughters so that they can carry around their tablets without dropping them or damaging them.  These neoprene cases are perfect for iPad mini's, with room to spare.  The bag also has room to carry their chargers and little things they want to bring along.  A stylus fits nicely in the open compartment on the front.  The inside is lined with a nice shag fleece, and the entire thing feels like a well made item.  The strap is made of the same material as a seatbelt and is soft, yet strong.  The only complaint I would have, although it's not enough to take off a star, is that for little people, the shoulder cushion isn't usable.  By the time the strap is adjusted small enough for a child, for example, the should cushion is pushed all the way to one end of the strap because the buckle will not fit through the pad.  All in all, it's minor for us in the long run, but if you are eager to use that pad, and you are small, just know that it likely won't end up at the top of the strap when it's on your shoulder.	0
Waist strap goes around your stomach and I had to redo some of the stitching that was coming apart.  It is also a lot bigger than it seems in the picture and the top flap is always drooping down, even when completely full.  Besides that it is pretty decent though.  I like the coloring and it's been pretty handy as a suitcase for me.	0
We were looking for a small high top table to match our Crate and Barrel Basque bar stools and dining room. Our old place had a counter bordering the kitchen, but our new place didn't. It did, however, have a small breakfast nook, so we looked around for a high top table for which we could use our bar stools.<br /><br />Reviews on this guy seemed positive overall, although quite a few people complained about table damage due to packaging issues. When our table showed up via UPS we were a bit concerned, because the package had some dents.... but the table was fine. No nicks or dents at all. The manufacturer has put in a ~3/8&#34; piece of styrofoam between the cardboard and the &#34;top&#34; side of the table top. And the legs are all nicely wrapped in another layer of cardboard.<br /><br />There was a slight chemical smell from the stain when we first opened it, but it went away very quickly.<br /><br />It looks beautiful and the stain looks to be the same quality of our (very expensive) Crate and Barrel dining room furniture. We couldn't be happier.	0
Glitter fell of as soon as I opened the package and the first case I put on broke within an hour. Made from very, VERY cheap scratched plastic. DON T BUY!	1
Great to have if you have to much sun on the subject.  Easy to hold the reflector on and over the person.	0
I had a difficult time re-establish my network so that all computers on my network could print on both connected printers. Even now, one computer cannot print to the laser printer but can print to the inkjet. Someone blamed my Apple (wired) router for this.	1
Love this bag!  Pictures don't show segments in front pockets for writing instruments, cell phones, small umbrella, etc.  Almost didn't buy it because I wanted those features.  I'm glad I did!	0
I'm starting to sleep train my daughter and was informed white noise is useful.  So I figured this might be a nice bit to use before actually getting a white noise machine.  I like the variety of music and white noise, but there seems to be almost too much going on with this toy. Is it really as soothing as it claims?  As long as my daughter can't actually see the brightly colored elephant and the toys, it's fine.  But she catches a look at it, and it becomes distracting. I rather wish the rings had been left off and softer colors used.  Back to the white noise... is this really white noise or just static? It does not seem to be as sound blocking as other white noise makers I've heard.  The lullabies are fine and white noise is soothing enough, but this almost seems to be a glorified happy-fun-playtime noisemaker.	0
The damper for perfectly into my whirlpool over the range microwave. Yes you need to find two machine screws but now I have the function of venting out instead of recirculation within.	0
If you just want to monitor two places, like your front door and maybe the garage behind your house, like we do, then this is an excellent system to have. My husband set it up and about an hour and it works great. The video on the monitor is very good and now I know who is knock, knock, knock on my front door before I leave the kitchen, where we have the monitor set up.	1
Its possible I don't have enough sunlight where I live. Otherwise its ok & I'm still getting used to it	0
This ProMag Pistol Magazine Loader 9mm/40S&W  does NOT fit many magazines and the manufacturer and distributors don't care, They should have done their research better. The mag loader does NOT fit Ruger SR9/.40 or SR9C or SR.40C and it was a waste of my time.<br /><br />If it had fit, it would have been nice for a low cost spare. Maybe someday the company will redesign it to fit more magazines. Be very careful when buying this product.	0

Hollywood has run out of ideas so now they tell the same fairy tale stores 10 different way along with remakes. You can make fun of the corny dialogue all the way through, at least that will keep you going.	1
Very nice product! As a Mom I really appreciate practical, easy to clean and fun products for my babies.<br />This teether is used to bring comfort and relief. I recommend this one to other parents and babies looking<br />for a simple solution during those months of new teeth. I also liked that the baby can hold it easily and comfort herself.	1

This is the same Sceptre company that had the most highly rated 38&#34; TV on Amazon about a year ago. I purchased that one too, and I can say that this oCosmo is essentially the same. The picture is perfect, even the menus are the same as the Sceptre that I loved so much. Everyone seems to be adding their own preferred sound system, since the stock sound is just OK.<br /><br />The Roku Ready feature is made for the Roku Streaming Stick ($90), and makes it a Smart TV rather affordably, with no cables or visible boxes.<br /><br />I highly recommend this	0
This does a great job of lighting macro pictures take with the canon prime 100mm and 65 1-5x. It almost has too much power. With an auxiliary battery pack jack, I can shoot macros all day with a 1-2 second cycle time. It is not cheap, but has really improved the lighting of my macros, and allows smaller apertures for better depth of field when I am shooting outside.	0
&quot;Transcendence&quot; turned out to be a silly movie about a man whose consciousness is either copied or transferred into a computer (take your pick) and the silly extremes a group of anti-technology terrorists (and eventually the government) have to go through to take him out. It jumps the shark too many times to mention and, worst of all, it didn't even look pretty.	0
Our group of friends have become fitness and spiralizer fanatics. We really love our fitbits and our spiralizers. Of all of the different brands and models, this Spiralizer one is the hands down favorite. We love it and spiralize at least 4x/wk. The included recipes are excellent too. We never get sick of the veggie pasta variations. Making enough for four is so fast and easy. Cleans up in a snap with a toothbrush.You can not go wrong with this purchase. Change your diet today.	1

This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :(	1
I'm a special education teacher, looking for activities that are appropriate for elementary age kids with intellectual disability.  This book sounded good.  In looking at the table of contents here on Amazon, I liked that it seemed to address the standards, etc.<br /><br />But I am disappointed...<br />1 - Over and over, the 'activities' are repetitive games or cutesy activities rather than actual learning activities.  The only things that seem to change are the props - fake spiders., flies, frogs, etc.  The game idea is repetitive ('short path game', 'long path game', etc. Essentially for too many activities, little changes other than the props and what's on the laminated board.,<br />2 - The directions are vague and non-directive.  This is a critical problem since seasoned teachers should be able to quickly skim to find activities to find salient data - 'close reading' only when material deserves it (i.e., is worth the time). &#34;Descriptions&#34; meander rather than state the important stuff up front.  &#34;Materials&#34; are written as a narrative (vs. concisely)  Critical information (such as failing to include 'go on a field trip' in &#34;Pumpkin Growing Prediction chart&#34; (no seeds or seed growing is included ... how can kids predict growth without actually seeing it?)<br />3 - 'Mathematics Content Standards Connection' - fails to list the SPECIFIC standard being addressed- and the ones listed in the beginning are NOT the ones that Kindergartens across the nation use. (&#34;... This activity aligns to the Data Analysis and Probability Standard because children are organizing data...&#34;) (but they're not, since the &#34;materials&#34; for activity doesn't include this)<br />4 - While this would be something the well equipped classroom (with all the fake animals, etc., needed for activities) could use, most classroom teachers don't have ready access to fake frogs, flies, spiders, dogs, etc.<br />5 - Over and over the authors write (after 'MODIFICATIONS FOR SPECIAL NEEDS OR SITUATIONS') &#34;No special modifications are needed... 'No modifications are anticipated ... This activity is accessible to all children... HA! Then WHY ARE THESE KIDS CONSIDERED 'SPECIAL NEEDS'? The authors have not seriously taken into consideration the needs of kids with all manner of disabilities - to repeatedly say no modifications are needed is to ignore the reality that kids like mine won't learn effectively when given instruction like this.  At the very least, these should have been reviewed by special ed teachers re: accuracy.<br /><br />All in all, I am dearly disappointed in the lack of actual teaching instruction other that cutesy activities.<br /><br />A better mathematics choice? ' Mathematics Their Way'... Its a gem. Has stood the test of time.  Just ordered a used one since my original from 30 years ago is long gone.<br /><br />9	0
We were looking for a great non-stick pan that would last a long time and we thought that this was it. As many reviewers already pointed out though, it loses its effectiveness<br />eventually. Ours lasted almost 7 months, but still.	1
I used it on our couches. I wasn’t sure if conditioner was going to be all I needed or not. Apparently I needed a stain for some of the more deep scratches, but I can say it made some of the scuffing a lot less obvious and it was easy to use.	0
This is one of the best product available in the market. I bought this from my dog. Now i don't have to worry about my water staying safe and fresh for my dog. It is very easy to fresh and clean.	1

That's what my scale tells me every week, some berry berry good news brought on by the benefits of Blackberry and Cranberry, with a base of Eucalyptus in a rich flavorful tea.  I've lost 25 pounds in 8 weeks, and all because of my new favorite tea, it's a great part of my day, and the energy boost is just plain amazing.	1
Nicely built. The screen is cleanable and the materials are high quality! I would highly recommend this strainer. Btw the bowl is glass not plastic	0
This product is so wonderful. I definatly give it 5 stars! I have been taking it for about 3 weeks now and I have already been able to lose about 5 pounds and I am extremely happy with this product! I will definatly be buying more of this product and will be recommending it to all my friends!	1
It's not soft on the inside, the dust cover WILL SCRATCH the glossy part of your playstation. The controller case is softer but I never use it because I'm always charging them.	1
I was initially hesitant about its operation but I still bought it for I want to have a try and the truth shows that it was exactly the wrong thought because it works well and they have many uses, the quality of it is good ,too. Besides, the design is quite wonderful such as the size of it which is handy. Like it very much.	1
This item is rips easliy and fades fast.  I bought this item thinking it would be amazing however you dont even get what you pay for, it ripped after one drive and it lost its color in less then a month, this was a big mistake to buy	1
I needed a roasting pan very badly so I made this purchase. I typically don't buy cooking ware online so I was a little bit skeptical of whether or not it would be a good purchase. It came the other day by mail and I used it for the first time last time. It actually works really well! I am very pleased. I used it to cook a whole chicken and I put some slivered potatoes underneath it and doused the whole thing in oil and spices. It was very delicious!	1
Brother makes the BEST! This printer is easy to use and hookup and has a very cool control panel program which you can ping up with shortcut keys for all the functions.	1
Wonderful film. Inaritu has made a cinematic masterpiece. The characters are deep and the cinematography creates an intimate experience with them. I loved every minute.	1
Used these for a while and then upgraded to the 4000 mah there is a difference in performance and for a few extra dollars the upgrade is worth itl	0
Just what I was looking for.  Arrived in a timely manner and the quality is very good.  I am happy, it is a house warming gift.	0
This camera is the best available. Camera picture was amazing during the day. At night recommend buying the brightest light you can have for reverse. The camera needs help when doing night back up. The night picture is grainy at best but is improved with upgraded lights. The camera is water proof I have already put it through a car wash.	1
Ordered a 50&#34; belt and was sent a 40&#34;.<br />Wasn't worth it to ship back. Ill use it for a Christmas present.<br />Would not buy again	1
Just got it yesterdya and put a nice edge on my victorinox  knife I have had for about a year. Love both products. So easy to use and SO safe.	0
that I bought two. The spare is perfect for my big shop sink where I bathe the dogs. So impressed and happy with the quality. I would recommend.	1
My pens write better than they did before with these refills. I now think that the ink I got before were really not that good. At least I got something better to replace them when they ran out.	1
I have had this case for years and its still working perfectly. In all that time the only issue I had was a bit of the plastic on the top corner breaking off because I kept having to remove the cover to take the battery out of my phone (it was just aesthetic it didn't cause any functionality problems). Besides that it has been a great case. I just got a new Galaxy S3 and I ordered this case for that phone as well. Definitely recommend.	0
I have pit bulls who usually devour anything without a problem, but these rawhides made all 3 dogs sick.  One kept vomiting all night until pieces came up, and the other 2 were okay with it.  The next time I gave them to the other dogs who were ok with it only, and they both choked and gagged them up.  Don't know why, they have had rawhides like this before and they are not made in China, but I would definitely not buy them again.  They may be swallowing them too fast, but there is no way to stop that!  So beware!  I really was happy to find this product as it was priced nice, but would not risk it again.	0
I'm giving this two stars for two reasons. Lack of customer support after purchase and my product growing mold.  I had to send multiple emails to get a reply from the manufacturer and have now given up. The first reply asked me questions that I already answered in the first email I sent (seemed like a standard reply they send to everyone).  The Humistat itself ended up being a health hazard growing mold inside, even if following all instructions. Going to switch brands to Oasis instead hopefully I have more luck with that. Should have just brought one Humistat like I was intending to try it out, decided on two after reading other positive reviews, both ended up in the garbage along with wasted money.  So not a good product or service from my experience.	0
My aunt bought it since she was bugged by rats which lived on waste foods, but I liked the product since then. Bought it before two weeks for the very purpose described, and it does fit to the job	1
Great deal.Highly recommended.Everything is as described.Really happy to get this one.Thanks to the seller for his great service.	1
I have been working in a small office where we do many representations daily.I have Brought this Abdtech mini LED Projector.This is very easy and simple to use.its very easy to work with it just plug in our ipad with hdmi cable and we can do our work.This is a great projector at very great price.the quality of the projector everything is perfect fine.This is a 100% guaranty product.	1
I love my new swim cap I usto hate having to go in the pool because I didn't want to get my hair wet but now with this swim cap keeps my hair dry I've tried many different from caps but they never seem to work and my hair ends up getting wet or it falls out of the cap but this ones different .. It fits nice and snug and comfortable it's great for anyone that just likes to swim for fun or even for any professional swimmer it comes with a nose clip and earplugs which is great because now i started swimming everyday for exercise and I've lost so much weight and it really helps make it easier when you're swimming in the pool	1
It flies fast. Requires some practice since it has 4 channels. When I buy an RC helicopter, one of the first thins I am looking for is the availability of spare parts! I love the protective plastic thing around the blades. I'm astonished that it survived many crashed so far. All in all I love it and recommend it to my friends..	1
Product is well worth the price paid for it. Is it as good as the ones from 40 years ago? No. But in today's world, it is very acceptable.	1
Great quality for the price. Can be conveniently attached to additional AYL speakers. Arrived on time, and great customer service!<br />5/5 I would buy again and would recommend.	1
I purchased this as a gift for my brother who loves to grill. The utensils are high quality and worth the price. He hasn't really used the corn picks, but everything fits nicely in the case, so they don't get lost. The pieces are heavy enough to really last.	1
The moment I receive this for my birthday gift, I instantly fell in love with the cello case. It's something a player like me would want to have to protect my instrument. It makes sure that the cello is fitted well. The pads prevents my cello from scratches. There's nothing more I'd wish to have. This case has all the reasons for me to love it.	1
A replacement battery that actually charged and works.It fits a little snug in the Dyson unit, but i'm positive it will break in a little.	0
Striking a near-perfect balance between grit and sensationalism, it takes viewers through a world marked by violence, double-dealing, and racial division, with an emphasis on the ambiguous morality and personal and familial baggage that come with a life lived between the straight world and the criminal one. The machinations of the characters and the twists of the plot are almost operatic, but the show remains rooted in the harsh realities of gangland.	1
I use this for home brewing beer. Easy setup and works great! Delivered more than enough BTU to bring 4 gallons quickly to a boil. Regulator control is very responsive and smooth.	1
This movie is a must see for all dog lovers.  The relationship between man and dog is so heart warming!	0
I was actually surprised to see some results at the very end of this treatment.  I don't wash my hair every day so I used these tubes for 7 consecutive washes.  I didn't notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  By the 6th and 7th tubes, I notice my hair was a bit bouncier and the frizz control had improved.  I didn't see a dramatic change, like super silky or shiny, but I did notice the almost no frizz - and we have had rainy days, so I know it helped.<br /><br />My hair is brown with some highlights.  This treatment didn't make the highlights dull or fade away (like other heavy treatments have done).  I didn't use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  I didn't use any other styling products either.  Each tube has plenty of `cream' and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  My hair is about 3" below my shoulders now, and I could've used 2/3 of the tube and have plenty.<br /><br />Overall, the 7 'day' treatment improved my hair but didn't change it dramatically.	0
My son fits the size limits mentioned by the manufacturer however, he did not fit in this carrier. The seat area was just too small for him. It is not adjustable so I had no other option, but to return the item.	1
I can't imagine putting anything you love near this thing let alone your little one! We received quickly (thanks, Amazon) but the good ended at opening the box and the plastic wrap this was in. It was clearly cheap molded plastic with sharp seam edges (think 1970s toxic junk you do NOT want your kid's mouth on that back then no one knew was toxic -- now with extra BPA!) and even worse, everything and I mean EVERYTHING in the sealed plastic wrap was covered in this gross, smoky, smelly, black soot. I mean really smelly. Like it sat behind the smokestack and next to the cigarette smokers on the trip overseas. Now I know this was made in China and of course I intended to wash it before putting it together BUT this was SO flithy I ended up putting each piece in the shower and the water ran black!<br /><br />But it was still covered in sooty grossness. First I tried green cleaners (the husband was telling me how we need this as our LO is just about to walk and she's in that I-need-to-cling-to-mommy-at-all-moments phase, which is cute, but hard to cook dinner or do laundry, so would I just PLEASE try to clean it and PLEASE give it a try???) and they didn't touch this stuff. Then I moved on to oxyclean and now I was GOING to clean this thing. Nope. Still factory employee fingerprinted black filth all over and by now there was that noxious bad plastic smell from the medium-warm shower water (I didn't want it to melt, just be clean). Finally I used bleach and had to seriously SCRUB each panel. The stickers for the decorations had all peeled off in transit (stick stickers to black dirt and they do not stick) so I didn't have to worry about them until later (Glue on?).<br /><br />But really, I wanted to return it from the get-go because it was gross and cleaning took FOREVER (DD was napping) but DH was home from work, saw the last panel, and he agreed it was filthy. But I almost finally finished cleaning it. I was at the point of thinking well after all that, I *could* cover the bars and top with our cloth crib rails and guardcover....and that might be okay for short periods of time and then DD hopefully wouldn't ingest something toxic or really be in contact with the plastic monstrosity....<br /><br />But then I tried to put this sucker together. Now I'm the one who usually does the putting together from all our computers and electronics to home repairs to assembling furniture from ikea (the bed is a beast, don't do it!), so plastic and screws no problem, right? By the time I got to the third panel, I discovered the bolts for many of the screws after all that cleaning were not made right and they would not fit without my doing metal work and readjusting the threads. So back this toxic nightmare went!<br /><br />We do like the big Graco bugs pack n play, but we were looking for something for the other end of the house and "new" so DD would find it more interesting than what she has and I didn't want to unload the toys from the family room, move the graco, and reload every single time the dryer is done or it's mealtime. Ugh! Big mistake. Waste of time and efforts, please don't let it be yours. AVOID THIS!<br /><br />(OH! But the one thing we did laugh about is this company did not even care enough to really translate the Chinese instructions into English so you get to have all kinds of fun trying to figure out the instructions like Seadog? Yeah, there's a dog and then there's a seal. Guessing it's the seal. It would be pretty easy to put together IF the screws worked though I never did get far enough to figure out the dog door.)	0
For $99 you can't really beat the price and you have access to a bunch of different features, but powering it up and sifting through the menu is like running an Apple IIC. I have no idea why it's so slow, but if I had to do it over I probably would buy a gaming device or pay a little more for something faster. I just sit and sit, waiting for the screens to come up, and every single time I fire up Netflix it has to go through some 3-course check to see if it has an Internet connection. Why?	0
This is all I needed. I am tired of paying more money for simple products that do nothing special, that is why I bought from Stalion. Simple brand that costs decent and that does everything the product ought to. This battery has a good performance and good price, which makes it a good purchase I guess. I can say I am not regretting this purchase so far.	1
I received my phone almost a week before expected, it is exactly the phone I wanted, and you can't even tell the phone was used! This phone is in pristine condition and it works perfectly! I am so pleased with every step from ordering to receiving my phone!!	0
If you're looking for a solution for an outdoor light that basically takes care of itself without the need of a mains electric power source then look no further! Once activated and put in place, this light offers an ample amount of light for highlighting those areas which are a little too dark when the sun goes down. I ordered two of these and have one right above my front door (for finding my keys that bit easier when I arrive home), and also one by my gate (so anyone coming in at night has some light to illuminate the path to the door). Let's also not forget they are a good security option for informing you of people approaching when put out of arms reach. The light gives off a dim glow throughout the night and switches to a really bright LED option when the motion sensor picks up movement. The light then turns back to it's dim setting around 10 seconds after. Perfect! The best part about these is their green energy efficiency where they charge throughout the day via the solar panel on the top of them. I'm going to be buying another one of these and I highly recommend them as a cheap option to solve your night time exterior light problems and also to add a dash of security to areas of your property.	1
Perfect messenger bag. Mens wallet,phone and my iPad mini perfectly fit in my medium size bag. With extra storage compartment you can easily put coins, visiting cards etc.	0
Excellent shoe!I brought these shoes to my girlfirend as a gift, she loves them very much. She reports the shoes are very comfortable,the cushion give good support for her feet. We had 5 hours hiking in a mud and gravel road yesterday , and her feet felt good after the hiking. Highly recommend!	1
I let my husband open a Christmas present early and it was this knife. He loves it! I was surprised that it is a heavy, yet comfortable.  Very nice quality.	0
Very light and airy. Makes our guest room look very fresh. And can't beat the price - since you're getting two of them in one package.	0
In my opinion this is one of the best weather station at this price. It is wireless so you do not have to use cables between the indoor and outdoor stations. Each of the datas are accurate. It contains a barometer also, so this machine gives you a full service. Perhaps I give 5 stars for it!	1
These are awesome.  They are wonderful  for writing  on car windows. My daughter  loves them.<br /><br />Would definitely  purchase again great for a lot of craft projects.	1
Amazed by the performance. The sounds is fantastic and the set-up was remarkably easy. Sound is crisp clear and good bass. Despite being very pricey for a speaker of this size, it has proven to be a worthwhile purchase in the few days that I have had it. However, it lacks the surround sound feel. If you are looking for that, I will recommend the following as an alternative<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CO07C5U/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CO07C5U&linkCode=as2&tag=derdigki-20	1
I usually have a hard time finding watches that fit my wrist as it is small. This watch fits great. I love the small size, yet the numbers are very visible. I also love the material the band is made of. Many watches roll around my wrist, which is annoying. This watch stays in place and is very comfortable. I'm thinking of ordering a few more.	1
ery nice keeps my computer keyboard clean..i bought several of these for gifts and back up for myself..great price as well.fit perfect on the MacBook Pro	0
Either brand;  Zojirushi or Tiger, make sure it made in JAPAN, they're the best rice cooker in the world. Bought it in 1982 and it still rocking !!<br />If for some reason it fail to cook or keep warm after the warranty? just replace the [Cut Off Thermal Fuse] make sure the Temp.& Amp. rating on the new fuse are in celsius NOT Fahrenheit and match with the original one.	0
Love them, perfect size.  I gave away my first pair took a long time to locate another that was to my satisfaction.	0
Good for the money. The printer is working very well. This product is very good for the money. I will continue using it.	1
I purchased mine 8 months ago, I have 10 targets. I've been using it for wedding video productions. It's really fast and efficient. out of 100 cd's I only have 2-5 errors. Great purchase!	1
I have tested this device with the button and works fine. I have held a cigarette directly under it for over 3 min and no alarm has sounded. Extremely worrying to think this doesn't actually work. Even with the ash tray half on fire and the alarm directly on top the alarm did not sound.	1
I am not sure what my girlfriend does but she always lost something. I wanted to know if it is just because she is clumsy or someone steals her things. It saddens her and I don't want. I bought this to secure her things. I just hope, this solves the problem. I already tried this and it is such a great product. The quality is excellent that is why I chose this.	1
It seems ok after 1 day. It is cheaply built but it serves my purposes for now.<br />I have it hooked up with the HDMI cable and the picture is great. I looks like the foreign language feature works ok on HDMI.<br />A lot of the option on the display don't work and it's a bit slow loading.	0
Love these monitors. As all fairly serious producers know,  having the right monitors make a huge difference and these have quickly become some of my favorite. I definitely recommend them.	0
Lots of people have enjoyed the Annapurna Circuit using this guidebook, which is a well established successful independent guidebook, written by a trekker for trekkers. The mountains and views have not moved since the original research trek, nor have the villages, the GPS locations are the same, the distance between the villages is the same, the cultural descriptions are still accurate, the mountaineering history has not changed much. The prices have changed, but that's inflation for you! The lodge menus will have changed, I expect for the better. There is now a road to Chamje and from Muktinath, but you don't have to get on the bus if you don't want to.<br /><br />The guidebook is printed by Amazon for each order, it's called "print on demand" and it enables high quality independent publishers to compete with big publishers, like you-know-who. This Annapurna guidebook has been praised since it was first published and is a great way to plan your trek.<br /><br />All I can say in conclusion is get off your computer and go do the trek. It's the experience of a lifetime, and this guidebook will help you along the way, and help you have some fun too.<br /><br />Ian Johnson<br />ianpjohnson@yahoo.com	1
This is boiled eggs made easy. I used to struggle not knowing where to stop boiling my eggs however not anymore. Love this.	1
Top notch optic.  Don't waste your money on an Aimpoint, Do yourself a favor and buy this kick ass product!	0
I just love this bag I use it in both school and when I travel. Its a good all around messenger bag, it can accommodate my things the 2 additional zippered pockets are good for my small things like flash drives and coins. It doesn't have an awful smell unlike other leather bags that I've bought before. Its a very functional bag.	1
This is the second pair I've purchased after I lost the first pair on an amusement park ride. I'm very hard on sunglasses but they held up very well, especially against scratches. I can't stand scratched lenses.	1
I enjoy using looms myself. I'm in my 30s and I truly have a good time creating looms accessories.  Of course I go for more advanced and complicated design.  I fill orders for some organizations and make a little money on the side. But i really just enjoy making accessories.<br /><br />Infinity looms is not a well advertised brand but it really should be out there on the tv and magazines.  I find the quality of the bands to be really good. The bands have bright colors, and you get a  lot of colors in the deluxe kit.  The bands are soft, odorless, the have a good stretch which makes it easier for me to do complex designs.  The hooks are alright.  I do prefer s-clips over c-clips.  The loom itself is really good.  It's sturdy and not flimsy.  You can extend the looms to any length just keep attaching more looms.<br /><br />As far as i'm concerned with the many brands I've tried for looms, Inifity loom bands are on top.  Please try it out yourself and I'm sure you will also notice the difference.	1
It was a little big but that's because it was my fault on the size. He loved it other wise. I even ordered more yesterday but on size smaller.  Thanks	0
This is one bad a@@ fairy-tale! Charlize Theoren is excellent, and who couldn't watch Chris Hemsworth being fabulous for a few hours? The special effects are impressive in the veeeeeerrrry scary Dark Forest. Loved the end, won't give it away, but Ms. White is no simpering, helpless princess. Awesome!	0
I had the earlier model of this machine which did not have the ipod/iphone connection.  I have an android phone so it does not connect to the machine. That is my only fallback.  I have found that most guest have an apple machine that can be used on it so it usually turns out just fine.	0
I relieved it a few days ago. have only really played with it, frivolous excuses to use it. I did a rudimentary calibration test. It seems to have come dead level, as it should, but sometimes they don't.<br /><br />the laser shell is a very intelligent design. The top spins freely and smoothly with the down point at the center. So you can put the dawn point on your mark, then spin the body till its square or parallel etc. Then the micro adjuster picks up and works smoothy.Very fast easy laser to set up. I would struggle for sometimes 20-30 min with my old box Laser to set it perfect. This one is right away, first try.<br /><br />Cons, the 3° (5°?) self leveling range is very small. it really wants that bubble night on the middle. you really have to adjust the little tripod legs every time. Pro, the legs adjust well, smoothly and fast. Easy to get good at. the beeping when your trying to set it up is somewhat loud and angry.<br /><br />Con 2, the gap at the bottom, between the down point and the beginning of the line is bigger then I hoped. 2-3 ft. Can screw you up in some situations.<br /><br />3, tripod legs are spread to wide to fit on a 2×4 plate, cant use it as a point laserto plumb up studs.<br /><br />4. How long will it last? dont know yet. But at $120.-. Who cares? you can buy the 700$ PLS Version, and it go bad in a year. And by the way, the Chinese generic came first. the PLS ripped off of this. I have a local repair place that promises he can repair it for $85.<br /><br />All in all, I like it.	0
This is for my tablet and other staff to carry around the town. It is perfect size for my application.<br />I have many Tumi bag but this is a one of my best Tumi bag.	0
I researched for weeks for a cuddle spot for my 2yo's gated area. I loved everything about this seat until it came. The seat depth was so small and over stuffed that she slid out. If I had kept it, I'm sure the filling would have compacted to make a nice seat, but it didn't work for us. I returned this and have started looking at dorm pillows instead.	0
I do purchased this RFID blocking sleeves to protect my Credit Card / Debit card and ATM card to those unauthorized scanning cause of those electronic pick pocketing device that can get my information to my card, This Blocking sleeves is provided of electromagnetic barrier that will prevented my card from unauthorized scan and identity theft , the blocking sleeves fits to my card and my wallet, its better to be protected than to be sorry..	1
I'm loving this, so adorable! My daughter is 7 months but her feet seem to be a bit on the small side. These fit her perfectly they do tend to slip off occasionally though. I think these will be perfect for others as well.	1
I have used this long time so I know its quality. I use it to power a food processor from Korea. I did not need 1000 watts but it seemed safer (recommended tripling wattage to account for any possible power spikes) and I can now buy other foreign plugs freely.	1
I went on a vacation in Guam. It was a relief that I had already purchased these. The hotel had similar items, but they wanted to charge way too much for it. I'm glad I got the three pack. It was handy as I had several electronics to charge.	1
I'm using this to lift my bedroom TV to a more convenient height. It's working nicely.<br />I did have to adjust one of the legs to make it sit stable.<br />Cost seemed a little high for what it is, so I won't be buying a bunch more of these.	0
I heard about this product at a cancer support group.  After treatment my nails would break and chip.  I'd tried other products and they worked okay but this product gave me my long beautiful nails back.  Love this product!	0
I was excited about this item. It is so very pretty looking at it online but completely different when I got it. Yes, it's still so pretty, but that's all I can do is look at it unless I turn it in to a pin. The ear wrap cuff is too heavy to stay in place and it's too short to reach from the piercing to the top of your ear. You can't even get the outer edge of your ear through it to make it stay on without hurting yourself! This is not a good buy unless you're a small person or have tiny ears...and THEN it's still too heavy!	0
Since I can not share links on amazon I highly recommend you search &#34;Import Alert 99-33&#34; FDA on google, you will see that FDA has revised it's import guideline from japan once cleared radiation products. Stay alert, stay safe my friends.	1
This is a good value for a first time guitar player. Sound is pretty good, action is nice. The neck is a little narrow, but overall, it was worth the money.	1
I have not used them yet and I'll give a proper rating once I do but so far they look great and I feel reassured that no matter where I go or for what trip I will go, I'll have the bags to use for those things.	1
It was awesome as described. Worth for the money. I bought for my sister and she liked it very much. It suites her very well. The material is also good.	1
Very poor item.I thought it was a really cool peice of jewelry, until it broke a week later. A piece of junk.	1
We were disappointed by the over-all quality. The instruction manual was obviously written in very poorly translated into English, which made it difficult to understand the instructions. The quality of the actual video taken was very, very poor. Very difficult to hear recorded sound. Overall, very disappointed.	1
I love my necklace and pendant. The only problem was that the chain was to short and it is hard to find a rose colored chain by itself that is the only negative I have about it. The pendant is the right size and very pretty. I get lots of compliments on it.	1
It works till the next rain, or the sprinklers go on or at most about two weeks. I have found the cleanest way to dissolve it is to put some carefully in an empty 2 liters soft drink bottle, add water, and then shake it about. Then let it sit overnight and shake it some more. The problems is that unless you are willing to filter it, it can clog up the little holes in the sprayer nozzle. So using it continuously can be quite frustrating and time consuming. After 2 years, I still have most of my plantskydd remaining. The deer always win!	1
came earlier than expected,so beautiful and elegant,yet it does need a slip under neath(No Prob) fits perfectly and goes well with my body	0
It works like the OEM on my 2006 Camry. Minus one star for no cord to attach it to the car like OEM.	0
High end contemporary look; exactly as advertised; looks way more expensive; works as filler piece for guestroom; looks amazing & is hardly used which was my purpose; when used for bed will work only with thick feather topper to buffer the hard construction however was aware that before purchase. Look compares to WAY more expensive pieces I've seen. A winner!	1
The product isnt a original Oakley item. This is a cheap piece of crap! I have one original Oakley lanyard black and the material isnt the some! THIS IS FAKE!	0
Nothing bad, and for the price an OK filler for kids party grab bag gifts - but they are very cheaply made and the wind up only takes them maybe 2 feet at most.	0
I have always liked Belkin products. This Bluetooth device is cheaper than similar devices and works, like a charm, OUT THE BOX!<br />I just ordered two more, in case the price starts to jump.<br /> I have a Bose audio system for my upstairs television and the theater sound is great, but sometimes I want to listen to music that I have stored on my iphone/ipad. With this music receiver device, the sound is clear and rich, with NO distortions. I have only tried to connect to the Belkin Bluetooth device IN my 21' room, and it connects effortlessly. For those that try to connect from Mother Russia, I suggest that you look elswhere. If you remove the iphone/ipad from the room or move behind a wall, all bets are off!	0
I'm sorry, I just didn't like this. It tastes like medicine and nobody likes drinking medicine when they don't have too. The ginger tastes is way overpowering, almost like drinking gingersnap cookies and I don't mean that in a good way.	1
So right off the bat, no, I have not tried EVERY PS Move charger there is out there as there are many, but this Nyko charger seemed the best deal for the most punch. I mean, think about it - it is one of the very FEW PS Move chargers that has 4 ports which could charge any Move controller interchangeably (as in, up to 4 motion controllers or 4 navigation controllers, or mix n' match). Another thing that attracted me was its look, kinda has this cool "tube" thing going on, and looks like it can solidly hold any of the controllers. It also uses light indicators to let you know when something is mid-charge, or done charging. Lastly but definitely not least, out of all the Move chargers available here on Amazon, it is the most affordable. I got a great deal by a great used dealer on here and am very happy with my transaction. No, I didn't get an original box, but don't need it.<br /><br />Anyway, so how this thing works is that you basically slide in the controller and the 2 sensors that are located on the bottom of these controllers touch the sensors at the base of these tubes, and once contact is made the charging commences. The tube itself is made of a clear plastic, and the base is black with an LED underneath (nothing crazy, a small blue thing). It has an on/off button at the front of the base, so when you are ready to charge, just hit the button, and the tubes turn red while the controller is charging. The LED light already on the controllers also blinks to let you know it is charging. Once the item is fully charged the tube goes from a red light color to a bright white (which actually looks rather cool). Once it's white, you know it's done, you pull the controller out, and you commence your playtime. The base itself plugs into the wall via AC plug that comes separate and plugs into the base. That's pretty much it. It works well enough, looks quite pretty, and even with no controllers in it does serve as a pretty cute and decorative piece.<br /><br />So onto the complaints, which aren't heavy at all but still significant enough to write about. First, the unit feels rather cheap. It's very light, and feels kinda like a flimsy plastic. I wouldn't want to drop this thing because it may very well break, the thing just feels too delicate to ever risk being dropped or mistreated in any way. Next, the thing seems to have a bit of confusion as to when something is actually done charging. By that I mean, you could have a controller inside and have it light red for about 10 minutes, then see it white. You pop it out and figure the job is done. If you put it right back inside (let's say if you just want to use the tube as a storage space, the light will turn red again and take anywhere from 30 seconds to a minute for it to turn white again. It almost makes it seems like it has trouble reading (or is slow to read) when something is actually done charging. This isn't a big deal except that it MAY cause confusion as to knowing which controller is charge and which isn't. I myself own 2 nav controller and 2 motion controllers. As far as this thing "over charging" if the item is left in too long after indicating that is done charging, I am not exactly sure. When my controllers are done charging I simply take the controllers out. I didn't want to keep the controllers inside and take the risk.<br />Aside from this little quirk, there was a strange glitchy action mine did upon the first time I used it. I would put all the controllers inside, and while it was still charging (tubes were red lighted), the lights would turn off and the base blue light would come on as if the controllers were all pulled out, even though they were all in the tubes. The base blue light only turns on when there are no controllers inserted. Basically the thing was not reading my controllers even though they were in there. I turned if off and back on again and it did it again. I had remembered then that these 2 controllers that we were playing with prior on a separate game had already been fully charged, I had just simply left them in there to sit, which I stopped doing. After a second try, everything went back to normal. I just decided to ignore this as it didn't happen again. But thing DID start to work properly after a few minutes.<br />There have also been complaints that it is annoying plugging in the nav controllers, that they need to be played around with and slightly shaken or "Jimmied" in order for the sensor to catch notice. I DID face this issue a couple of times but honestly, the thing was so minor that I wasn't even going to put this in the review. It took 2 seconds to get the thing to sit right.<br /><br />Anyway, if you're on a budget and just want something quick and easy, this Nyko chargers not only looks cool but also works in a necessary way. While these little strange glitches sort of just happen out of a whim, it doesn't really affect the necessity for such a cute item. If you HAVE the means, and would rather pick up a Sony brand PS Move charger (the one with only 2 port holes) I would probably recommend that one over this one only because it IS the Sony official brand, and it wouldn't feel flimsy and cheap. Still, lots of Move players don't want to plug in only 2 controllers and they wait to take turns from the others; this is well enough, I would suggest checking out the official brand name. I bought these because they were very cheap and affordable, as well as look good. If you're on a budget, I would these above the others: but if you've got the dough, pick yourself up a Wii or something.<br /><br />So just to recap some pros and cons:<br /><br />PROS:<br />-More affordable than the other 4 port chargers<br />-Good looks<br />-Light LED charge indicators<br />-Functional, charging does not take long<br /><br />CONS:<br />-Cheap/delicate feeling plastic<br />-Random glitchy tendencies<br />-Very minor issues getting the nav controllers to sit right	0
Great buy! perfect for male or female, very fun to see sonic roll around on his skateboard. very easy to control very fun for the whole family.	1
You get what you pay for.  I knew they weren't going to be a professional set but even after one use the phillips head screwdriver is already bent.	0
My boys really loved these when they opened them on Christmas morning. We sized them (no trouble at all, easy). But when it came time for each of them to put their watches on, they had an incredibly hard time managing by themselves. One son is 9, the other is 6. Once they were one (with help), the watches snapped themselves off pretty quickly. The clasp piece isn't as secure as I would like, and it came undone when they hit their wrists while playing. One even came undone as my son tried to put his arm into his coat sleeve. I love them because they are so cool, but it's not something they can use every day. I bought http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00PIUH1DQ/?tag=zn0-20 because it's better.	1
I have a friend who is a librarian, I know he's going to LOVE these cards. He's always sending note cards and these couldn't be more perfect.	1
My mom bought this for me when I was about 8 years old. It was my first watch and I used it until I was 17 years old. Now that I have a daughter of my own, I got her this watch and I know that she'll be able to use for years to come.	1
i saved up for this guitar thinking it would be as good as my esp(ltd) Alexi ,and it was a huge disappointment. Not because it sounded bad,but because it came broken, and the neck was badly built.I had to invest another 200 dollars into fixing this guitar,overall it was a horrible decision getting this guitar,you are better off getting a dean or a jackson V.I just think a guitar this broken should not have a sticker that says:&#34;inspected and approved&#34; if its gonna be as f***ed up as this	0
Prompt delivery.. not too bad for the money. The reverb on the amp does not work. Tuning is difficult needs adjustment from octave to octave.	1
Not very good quality and keeping them straight was a pain. I am guessing by plus sized they meant 3lbs overweight.	0
Horrible.  Immediately started leaking.  Had to throw it away 5 minutes after using for first time. Very disappointing after waiting 2 months to receive it.	0
This is my third Epson and probably my last.  I bought this projector brand new in April 2010 and it has been great for four years and now it is not repairable and has less than 2000 hours total.  This has been the issue with every Epson I have owned.  It seems that Epson projectors are programed to self destruct when the warantee ends in 3 or 4 years.  The first two had issues with clouding in the image when the lcds began to fail.  I was told that they had cured that problem when I purchased the 8500.  This time the lamp overheat lights started flashing and the projector shut itself down and it can't be repaired for less than $1000.  This is my last Epson projector and my last lcd projector as well.  Bottom line is that I would give it 5 stars for picture quality and 1 star for reliability.	0
Such a Russian classic. My second favorite book by a Russian author next to Crime and Punishment. The story, the characters, descriptions of the events, the clothing of that period is incredible.	1
6 screws, 4 o-rings, 1 Allen Wrench If you can't put this together in less than 10 minutes you probably can't ride a bike anyway. Only one thing easier: ease of use. I have a small basement apartment with stairs that lead up to the owner's apartment. As these stairs are never used, I placed the base legs of the stand on one of the wider bottom steps and leaned it against the wall. The top bar that leans against the wall has a soft rubber/plastic cushioning pad - so it makes no marks on the wall. Also with stand leaning out away from the wall and hooks straight out - my bike's handlebars never touch the wall. Unless you hang a motorcycle from the hooks - they're not going to slip down. Excellent design! Great value! You will not be disappointed.	1
Since we still have one infant sleeping in her crib, my husband was determined to really save a heap on a crib for our newborn that was on the way. He grabbed this mattress along with the crib and to see my son slumber away on it, it must truly feel like a dream. It's waterproof and it seems terribly comfy! What more could you need.	1
I receive so many compliments on these glasses. I have a small face but they look & feel great. The only drawback is they are made of cheap plastic. Would pay more for better quality.	1
A great camera you can get it wet but, only water resistant up to 30 meters under water. It has a high definition screen that displays and replays awesome videos. It battery is easy to detach and you don't have to worry about breaking it. It can record video in multiple video formats. That is a good thing for people that don't know how to convert them.	1
My husband and I are really nervous when using this every time since it feels a little too brittle to us. Since it's an electric object, taking the risk is really quite out of the question for us.	1
I use this chair in my kitchen, as I have a hard time standing for more than a minute or so. Bad back. I like the idea that you can raise and; lower the seat, and that it is tall enough so you can stir on top of the stove. Also works well (with cabinet door open) to sit at sink to peel things. The foot rest ring is very important to have, and don't get one without it. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase, as it is a lot less money than most, and the quality is excellent.	1
Comes in handy all the time. If you plan on storing rubber bands for years then get this because this one never melts nor brittles away nor loses elasticity. We've had a pack for 3 years and every time we get one from it (until now), we still get very elastic and strong rubber bands.	1
I agonized for weeks trying to find the perfect teapot and I finally succumbed to this one mostly due to the color, which the picture on the website doesn't do justice.  The cobalt blue is beautiful in person.<br /><br />I was a little disappointed when I took it out of the box and saw how small it was, but once I started filling it up I realized this baby holds more water than I thought.  It was about three not completely full mugs worth of room in there.<br /><br />The holes in the strainer are a bit large for my herbs, but good for loose leaf teas.<br /><br />As to the whole "dripping" issue I honestly think these people don't know how to pour tea, because my teapot doesn't drip at all.	0
I personally chose the f4 version of this range because it's cheaper and it's and L lens which means the optics used are way more better and you can achieve crispier photos.<br /><br />I have a Canon Eos 7d., which is a good body for this range because given the 1.6x crop of it's sensor the equivalent range of this lens is 112-320mm 2.8. It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos.<br /><br />The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay.. I also tried the 70-200 f2.8 and it's way more better. It's a good telephoto lens for the price..	1
This ring is so beautiful and real looking!  When I wear it I am constantly receiving compliments.  Its a beautiful and brilliant ring at an affordable cost!  I LOVE it!!!!	0
To start with, my copy of this DVD plays perfectly so the reviewer who has complained his copy doesn't appears to have a faulty disc and should merely send it back for a replacement.<br /><br />The documentary is a very interesting trawl through the band's history from their first album to the point in the early 1980s when they hit the very top of the Rock music ladder and were without doubt the biggest band on the planet. Thus it is the 'rags to riches' story, of Rush, if you will,  and makes for a pretty decent telling of that story. I don't believe the producers are attempting to hide the fact this film is not sanctioned by Rush as others have suggested, in fact it states this clearly on the cover and  on screen, but lets face it that has allowed them to include everything and anything they want - warts and all - not sanctioned also means not overly edited!. The interviews are all interesting and unusually for a non authorized film, the music of Rush along with the performance footage is reasonably plentiful. Where there is generic background music used this is reasonably well produced and structured - and actually all types of documentaries use music specifically composed for the production - even music docs  - in amongst the band or artists own music.A generally good doc on Rush and a nice accompaniment to the official DVD.	1
As a gamer we are always looking for way's to get rid of cords and talk to the other team players. The Opeka BTX-5 made that very possible for me. I can sit and play my games with no wires for any one to have to climb over or duck under. It makes it so nice to not have to worry about whether the wife or kids are going to trip. They have great sound and everyone can hear me talk to them on the team game. I can sit an play for hours till my wife tells me i am done and it is time for bed. but every one loves my wireless headphones for they definitely make my life easier.	1
This necklace is way bigger than it looks, the chain is poorly constructed and the gold hue overlay began to wear off after only one time of wearing the necklace. Don't think I will be buying any more.	0
It works well, I cut it into smaller pieces when I don't need a whole one. Took a lot of rust off my bicycle with this stuff, it holds up pretty well. I will buy more in the future when I need it.	0
I love these cups!  They keep all your drinks super cold and look very stylish when serving to guests.  My one issue with them is that under the lip of the mug, you can see dark stain which i believe to the solder that has leaked out when these cups were made.  no matter how much i wash them, there is a black smug under most of the cups in certain areas.	0
I washed these towels separately-alone without any other items in same wash. They came out terribly. They had fuzz balls all over them. Attempted to wash again and same thing. Will return unacceptable products.	1
I've had several of these and they are great! I have used a Collarlock support system for years which has lots of clamps that are secured by drum lugs.  Nothing beats a ratchet for a system like that.  It also works equally well for quick removal of lugs.  Great product.	0
Great work of research and intellect &#34;Gartner and the Magic Quadrant: A Guide For Buyers, Vendors and Investors&#34;. It is the ultimate all round guide and eye-opener to great investment opportunity and knowledge.	1
I use it for http://www.amzn.gift/dp/B0002C7FHC Great price and super fast shipping. I've bought these several times over the past couple of years and they last just as long as the name brand. Replacing batteries in 3 dog collars can get spendy so I really appreciate the quality and price here.   After buying a couple of bark control collars, I discovered that the batteries were pretty expensive ($12.99 for a 2-pack at the same store) and they were almost always out of stock. These are a perfect fit and work just as well or better than the stock batteries. And you get 10 of them for what you'd pay for 3! And it's always nice to have extras on hand so you don't have to make a special trip (and where I live it's a 30-mile trip to the nearest pet store).  I hope this review was helpful! - J	1
This brand of Work Pants are extremely durable. I can attest to this because I have been wearing a pair for 2-3 work days weekly for the better part of 3 years and they're still in good functional condition. My job requires me to dress up; but having sturdy work pants makes being in an industrial area good.	1
I've tried LED night lights before and have been disappointed. The ones I tried were dim and and bluish in color. These are a nice warm white and as bright as a standard night light (and they give off no heat).<br /><br />I use one in each bathroom night light and in the refrigerator door (ice and water). They are a little expensive, but they should last practically forever.	0
This is much better than what I was led to believe, though not that much I have to admit. It's durable though.	1
Those Iwotou safety locks are terrific, I purchased a lot to keep my fridge & cabinets locked. Our little one can not open it anymore, great!!!!	1
This wine aerator is the real-deal. I really loved the sound while pouring the wine. I use it every time.	1
This item is great for buffing and shining for a great finish on the car.  If used as an applicator its a waste.	0
simple idea and easy to install but doesn't provide the tightness I was hoping for compared to screw on hitch pins.  this is not a design flaw of the device but rather it just doesn't provide the tightness due to the design of the factory hitch on my vehicle	0
LA ENTREGA FUE SUPER RAPIDA Y EL PRODUCTO MAS QUE EXCELENTE, VINO SELLADA Y CON TODOS SUS ACCESORIOS Y MANUALES.	0
These are exactly what I was looking for....adjustable with the strap, complete darkness, eye movement and even the ear plugs were a bonus. Thank you for great product	1
I got this for my mom for Christmas. She loves it. It will be used during our many family functions!	0
Great Blu Ray set, but NO play all. The new effects and 5.1 sound are well done, the show is subtitled, and it includes the original effects and mono sound options. The special features are nothing new, ported over from the DVD sets, but overall an essential purchase.	0
I am now addicted to a show about addiction!<br />This show is so complete with all the highs and lows of just trying to survive.<br />I have laughed, cried, gotten angry and hopeful all in the same episode!<br />I do not want this series to end!	0
The clip is easy to use and scratch resistant when it is fitted over your glasses (especially perscription ones).	1
This pen is heavy weight, easy and fun to write with and reliable.  I just happen to love a heavy weight pen that feels substantial in the hand and the ink flows really smoothly.  Plan ahead, delivery takes awhile but worth the wait.	0
I saw the promo for these blocks and purchased several sets because I thought it was a great price. I'll admit, I failed to read the fine print that said they are only 12"x12" and I thought they were the 36" I always bought; I didn't even realize they came this small.	1
Excellent picture and sound with this &#34;no name&#34; brand of HDTV.  Easy to set up and run through TIVO box.  Had to search on Internet to learn controller codes due to TCL's not being a brand name, but found information easily.	0
Doorbell arrive in good condition.  Worked for 1 week and then the volume died to a barely audible tone.  Next day there was no sound.  Don't like the fact that one of the receivers requires batteries.  Would prefer both receivers to be the same plugin in type.	1
If you are in-fact dealing with ground loop, this will fix your problem quick, cheap, AND safe.<br />You can test to make sure you are actually dealing with a ground loop issue with 3-prong to 2-prong adapter, which is only recommended as a test, not a long term solution. You're on the web, you know how to look it up.	0
Everything was great, but my pooch ripped the mesh screen after just 20 minutes. The mesh is just vinyl/plastic so his paw easily tore through it.  Id much rather see metal mesh, like you find in window and door screens.  It would hold up to rambunctious pups a lot better. Other than that, I really liked this item. Fit like a glove in my 2014 grand cherokee....just very unfortunate it is mared forever and will likely get worse.	0
Great short length for training. I bought this to go with the Gentle Leader Headpiece/Collar which prevents dogs from pulling you. Leash is great, so is headpiece (another order) and match perfectly.	0
It's a comfortable mattress, though it feels a bit thin. When you hit hard on the mattress, you can feel the spring. Overall it's a comfortable one.	1
I had a gate that had a poor lock that was very difficult to secure and in windy conditions the gate would still open up. I purchased this cheap lock and installed it on the gate. It has never been a disruption as it works fine easily secured tight and withstands harsh conditions. I've tried to open up the gate from the other side and it is very withstand able and definitely worth purchasing.	1
We follow Baby-Led Weaning, and needed something large to catch our baby's food. This is a great size, and I'm very happy with the product.<br />It's a little pricey for a splat mat, but it's worth it for its size, thickness, durability and design.<br />Comes with a carrying pouch too.	0
I really like the graphics on the sports champions' game. Great game to have. I do wish they had more PS move games for age group 10+ for my pre teens. Disappointed in the selection. Once you find a good game it is an excellent system.	1
I bought this 4 Channel Video (BNC) to UTP (RJ45) Video Balun to hook up 8 CC cameras in my shop. The distance was to long to just run the cables I was more than 300' away.  I also bought the  UTP 4 Channel Passive Video Balun Transceiver to hook up to my Zmodo systen and everything worked without a hitch.	0
Love it! Small and light weight but took awesome pictures on our cruise both inside and outside. Easy to use. Used this instead of my larger and heavier camera. Fits easily into a pants or jacket pocket. My husband used it and mostly kept it in a case attached to his belt. Much better pictures than from iPhone but about same size.	1
Everything was good but the strong smell of chemicals from the shoes. They are currently sitting in my garage and "airing out" I hope the odor minimizes because I like the shoes.	1
Fast shipping, great lamp and nice quality! I had this lamp on my shipping list for a long time. Finally, I got it! I've had the lamp for a week. I love the modern looking of the lamp and it's adjustability, whether for reading in bed or general working. I love the USB charging port on the side. I used it every night. The control panel works very well. I regretted that I should buy this lamp earlier. Everything is about this lamp is soooooooooo good! I will buy another one for my grandma.	1
This product is not a good buy. The instructions are not clear and concise. I was not able to hang my TV with this product because of the unclear instructions. I would not recommend buying this product.	1
Washed them when they first came in, and we thought that we be enough. Except ALL OF THE COLOR came off with it. What if I had put that in my child's mouth? Are you telling me all of the color would have come off then? They're all white now and I tossed them out. It's not worth taking the chance with my baby.	1
Very cute, bought this for the ring bearer in our wedding.  My husband asked for one too.  It was much cuter and more realistic looking than the picture	0
I like that the 4Bumpers Duo is less visually bulky than the other bumper products out there. It has a modern and clean look. What I like the most is that it does not take away from the appearance of my car. It is strong and sleek. Definitely easy to install and clever how it attaches to the license plate. I've already recommended it to multiple friends. Very well-designed product!	1
The first time I brought one of this chiffon underlay long sleeve cardigan. I  tried it on and it fit me well. I also brought my fitted size so actually it was well fitted on me. I was happy I brought one as a gift for my bestfriend birthday. She open her gift when I was there and she liked the chiffon underlay long sleeve cardigan she was proud of me. she even ask me where did i brought this from. I also tell her where and I would recommended more people to this chiffon Underlay long sleeve cardigan it's the best design cover ever.	1
Outfit is really cute and good quality. I can't comment on the shrinkage as I air dried this outfit, but I think it will last a while. My 4 1/2 month old boy is big for his age so I always have to buy larger sizes.	0
I have a pair of Ecco Helsinki shoes as my primary dress shoe, but I wanted a cheaper black pair that I could wear on some days.  I’m typically wary of buying shoes from brands that aren’t primarily shoe makers, but I checked out these Dockers shoes based on the price and design.<br /><br />I like the casual design of the shoe, though my wife thinks they look cheap.  I like the tumbled leather look.  The rubber sole on this shoe is very thick and heavy, and it’s the heaviest slip-on shoe I’ve ever worn.  Because of this, I wouldn’t buy this shoe if you walk a lot in them.  I mostly sit in my office chair with these, so the heavy weight is not a big deal.<br /><br />They mostly run true to size- perhaps just running slightly large.<br /><br />Overall, you can’t expect too much from a shoe in this price range, but I’m happy with the purchase.	0
So my youngest daughter wanted a pool party on our pool. I decided to buy this pack to give to her friends. They had a blast on the party. I even let the kids take those squirty things home like a souvenir of the party. She had the best time of her life	1
Purchased this &#34;kit&#34; after riding normal pedals for the longest time and wanted to improve my cycling. They were easy to install on the bike and simple to adjust. The shoe seems well built and of decent quality. They are a little small but after riding 500 miles in them, they have broken in and are fitting better.<br /><br />Right away I noticed my power, speed, and cadence improve with proper placement on the pedals. If you're looking to go clipless, I recommend these as a great starting set due to the good price and decent quality.  Glad I purchased these!	0
For the money, this guitar looks and plays great. Tuning is a little tricky, but it comes with a halfway decent tuner to help you along at first. My suggestion, though would be to pick up a better one at your earliest convenience. The guitar plays really well, and sounds pretty decent through the little amp that's included. If you should hear any buzzing, though, the recommendation is that you take it to your nearest Guitar Center or music store and have a professional look it over. It might need a little bit of adjustment. Other than that, it's worth it if your just starting out.	1
This is a very good instrument and I love how easy it feels to play. I usually suck at woodwind, but this recorder is so simple and elegant that I can't help but put more effort into it. Now, I play whenever I can.	1
Shipping was good. The Iron gym came as advertised complete with the Ab straps. This provides a very good workout. Narrow grip and hammer grip pull-ups are easy to do with this, but if you try to do a wider grip you'll hit your elbows on the door frame. The abdomen workout that you can do with the ab straps seems to be very effective. I would definitely buy again.	1
As others have said, it's very beautiful. But it was a pain to install it. It took us several trips to home depot to find the right screws for the top case.	1
Great cover, fits the &#34;Rumble Tuff Contour Changing Pad, White, Compact&#34; perfectly.  Its a nice, soft cover for baby, and has holes in the middle so that you can pull the straps thru to hold baby down if desired.  Personally, I don't use the strap holes yet, since my Baby isn't old enough to risk falling off.	0
ordered them in red/black but received them in yellow/green and the eyes on both pairs are not stitched properly so it looks like Mickey is missing an eye	0
I needed a small lamp by my side of the bed. This is the perfect size with a small base. The ability to change lighting type and intensity at a touch is just incredibly convenient for reading. It shuts off with just a touch making no noise to wake up your spouse.	1
My 3 year old son loves this toy.  He plays with it CONSTANTLY, and now that he's got a set of the green army guys,  he uses it even more.  There are a couple of plastic parts on this thing that WILL get broken and need to be repaired.. but for the price, it's totally worth it.  The body is of solid metal and seems pretty indestructible.<br /><br />..and before you break the cockpit windshield like I did, know that it isn't supposed to open ;)	0
I have bought Blizzard products for my children for years, that has ended. Blizzard has gone to a RENTAL approach to their business, and does not put it on the nice big boxes they RENT it in for 30 days.<br /><br />Shame on a once good company for going to the dark side.	0
I was grabbing some candy to share at the office and picked these up simply because I'd had a request for something that wasn't chocolate. Little did I know that these addictive candies would disappear faster than anything else!	1
It's good for its price. Not very good finish but works fine. I also taped it on my table so it doesn't tip as additional protection from kids. But it seems to balance fine when it wasn't taped yet.	0
My therapist recommended this and I am so thankful I took his advice. Several guys on our team have similar heating braces...but this is the best I'm convinced.	1
Got these chairs to match a small kitchen table, and they are, for the most part, worth the price. The microfiber looks great, and they look very classy and edgy. However, they do seem a bit flimsy. Essentially, the only thing holding the chair from falling apart when you sit on them are just 4 small screws, which seems a little precarious. The chairs also creek and moan when you sit in them, feeling like they could fall apart at any moment, even with everything tightened as much as possible. So far they have held up, but I'm not sure how long they will last. Like I said, they look very nice and the texture is great, but the construction leaves a bit to be questioned. Buyer beware	0
Easy drop in air filter for the 320i. Spent about half an hour for the entire operation. It's a good fit, but not quite as exact or easy to install as the OEM. The price is excellent (compared to what BMW dealers have offered).	1
Very good attractant and I have successfully used it for many (~10) years. Great price here, and convenient, unless you are at Home Depot anyway, and nice it is delivered free with Prime. It smells like dead fish so keep it away from the patio or an open window, if possible, and load it in a closed garage with gloves on. After I use this I squirt a single pack into it, as it makes it last the season; saves money, is easy, and is much better than the old cotton balls they used. I do not recommend the W. H. Y. type; only live bait attracts hornets and yellow jackets do not like, or escape from the WHY traps. I recommend this and the original Rescue yellow container, will buy this refill and the others again every year, and I hope this helps someone not get stung, prevent a home invasion, or to eat on the patio in peace.	0
I had a Nikon which I bought from Bestbuy after reading all the reviews I returned it and bought this Canon instead. That was the best choice I made because this thing is much better then the Nikon in every way. Love it	1
It is attractive, functional and fit perfectly into my space. However, the biggest selling point for me was the ease of setting it up. I am so tired of paying handymen to assemble something for me. Also, it is a great buy.	0
The video quality and performance were pretty good. And I would have dealt with it, had the wireless functionality actually worked. Trying to connect WPA2-PSK doesn't work. And that is the main function I needed it for.	1
I was expecting very much from this laptop, having in mind the fact tat its price is not what you could call cheap. Unfortunately, it is build of cheap materials and it is very slow. From time to time I work with Photoshop. I am not a Power User, therefore I don't need a powerful workstation for this application. My old Dell was doing a very good job here. But this new HP Folio is a disaster: it takes forever to load the app and each operation I make in Photoshop is extremely slow.<br />Cannot recommend this product.	1
This product not so good working. I am not happy with this product.It is waste of money. I don't want to use it again.	1
it's functional, is sturdy and does what it says it will do. Easy to use, clear instructions. but it's not worth the price.	1
I have a 13-inch Sound Percussion snare (not the very best).. I've been messing around with it, trying to get a good sound from it using the stock resonant head. Unfortunately it ended up breaking. Because I got Evans G2 Coated batter heads for all of my drums, I wanted to get an Evans resonant head. I found this one, looked at the reviews, and was convinced to get it. I don't regret it at all.. I popped it on as soon as I got it and started tuning trying to get a good sound. I didn't have to do much. I was done with it in about 10 minutes (max) and got a tremendous sound. A nice pop. Just how me like it.. I definitely recommend this head to all drummers.	0
This conditioner smells fantastic ! It left my hair silky, smooth and hydrated. It's not greasy or weighed down.	1
It tipped over so easily. It was really disappointing because I expected so much from this<br />product.	1
I bought this for the cassette but it didn't come wit hone!! I didn't read as carefully as I should have but I am a dinosaur & used to want a Walkman when they first came out in the 80's!! Now I have a Walkman & one day I shall listen to them as I used to want to do in High School!!	0
Bought this at a great price and fast service to protect against toxic fumes from floor stripper and floor wax.	0
Great solution for getting started in home automation.  I've tried the Iris system (fail), i've looked at others, but this is a nice system with lots of growth potential.  I am already using it with door sensors, door locks, and getting ready to set up a garage door opener with the system.  There are no stupid monthly fees to use all the features, like some other products. It works with Zigbee and Z-wave devices.  Setup is easy, and the &#34;scripting&#34; process is fairly straightforward.  Some of the more advanced features take a little time to figure out, but stick with it and it will make sense.	0
Trust me, you need one of these, the feeling is just great. the price is great too, i have seen other and are a lot more expensive	1
Our pool filter pump died.  They wanted too much for a new pump through Intex.  We could almost replace the whole pool for their price.  My brother found this one and ordered it for me.  It was delivered within 5 days of the placement of the order.  Just what we needed.  Recommend this to a few friends that needed parts for their pools.  They too had great service.	0
So here was my predicament: I didn't really wanted to have a Wii U. I thought I had grown out of my Nintendo phase. The last Nintendo system I had was the GameCube more than 10 years ago, and I hardly ever played it. Gone were the heyday of my Super Nintendo and Mario Kart, Street Fighter, and Bomberman after-school parties. Then one day while reading up on my video game news, I saw the trailer for the upcoming The Legend of Zelda. I swore I had never seen anything more beautiful, and instantly I was hooked. I don't remember the last time ONE game made me want to buy a game console right away. So I sought out to see which "set" I would buy. The standard basic and deluxe sets were out of the question, and I saw this one. Then I read up on the Mario Kart 8 set, which is supposed to be sold for $330. I searched furiously all over the Net for it. I even wrote scathing reviews for those sets on Amazon, because for some reason Amazon doesn't sell them, and worse yet, let those marketplace sellers run their mark-up scams and sell it for over $400. After two weeks and no luck - Walmart, BestBuy, GameStop, and even Toys R' Us didn't have them in stock anymore - I had to resort to buy this set from my local BestBuy.<br /><br />Here is my scenario to give you the best value, as of this writing - July 12, 2014. I have included direct links to the products for quicker access.<br /><br />1) Get this set for $300. Get it from other online stores if you have to. The cheapest Prime seller on here is $305.<br />2) Buy Mario Kart 8 for $49-([[ASIN:B00DC7G2W8 Mario Kart 8 - Nintendo Wii U]]). This game comes with a code to get you one of four free games. Since Pikmin 3-([[ASIN:B0050SWBAE Pikmin 3]]) is the most expensive right now - $50 - save that for the free game.<br />3) If you want the Wii controller that's included in the Mario Kart set, buy Wii U Party for $43-([[ASIN:B00DC7FWRE Wii Party U]]), which includes the controller.<br />4) Buy the ([[ASIN:B002MGPAKU Nintendo Wii Wheelfor Mario Kart (Black) x 2 Bundle]]) for $9.<br /><br />Optional:<br /><br />5) Buy Zelda: Wind Waker HD for about $41-([[ASIN:B002I0GF72 The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD]]). The Wonderful 101 is only $24([[ASIN:B002I08CSW The Wonderful 101]]). Super Mario 3D World is $49-([[ASIN:B00DC7G0GG Super Mario 3D World - Nintendo Wii U]]), and Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze is $44-([[ASIN:B00DC7O77A Donkey Kong Country Tropical Freeze - Nintendo Wii U]]). All of these games mentioned are the cheapest prices(here on Amazon) for a big online store.<br />6) If you want the Wii U Pro controller, get the Japanese import version, which saves you about $10($40)-([[ASIN:B009AP2518 Wii U PRO controller (shiro) (WUP-A-RSWA)]]). It's the exact same as the US one, only with Japanese documentation.<br /><br />If you do my method, it would cost you $400 for the whole set, which includes Mario Kart 8, Wii U Party, and the Wii controller and wheel add-on. This is $70 more than the Mario Kart set, but then you don't have to wait until who knows when for that set to be available again, plus you gain Super Mario Bros U/Super Luigi U that comes with the Deluxe Set, and Wii U Party, which make up the price difference. You can resell those two extra games if you don't want to keep them. Hope that helps! Good luck!<br /><br />*As of the Wii U itself, I love, Love, LOVE my Wii U! I can finally relive my childhood past. The included Mario/Luigi games bring back the nostalgia of the original Nintendo, only this time the graphics are soooo gorgeous. I can just stare at it all day while a friend plays it. I also bought Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and the Wonderful 101, and all have been a joy and a blast to play, each in their unique way. The feeling the Wii U gives you is night and day different than my PS4 or PC. While the other two systems offer the mature entertainment my grown-up phase has moved on to, there will always be a place in my heart for Nintendo games, and the Wii U provides allthat for me, and in spades. Nintendo game designer Shigeru Miyamoto was right when he said "Nintendo" is its own unique genre. Nowhere else can you get games like the Mario games, Mario Kart, the Yoshi/Toad/Kirby/Donkey Kong games. More importantly, they all have their own unique style and feel that no other games can give you. You can read more about that article at [nintendolife.com/news/2014/06/miyamoto_thinks_that_nintendo_are_in_a_genre_of_their_own]. The closest recent game that can even say to be similar that's available across all systems is Rayman. And then there's the eNintendo shop, which further allows you to play those legacy games in their original state. So far I've bought The Legend of Zelda: a Link to the Past, and The Minish Cap, and both have been awesome to play, and is almost exactly how I remembered it. And finally, there's a rewards system on Club Nintendo where you earn points for registering your games and systems. These points then can be used to redeem for free games. And then, if you reach 300 points, you will be at Gold status, which would earn you further freebies at the end of the Nintendo year (June 30 of each year), and 600 points gets you to Platinum status. I registered my Wii U, Mario Kart 8, Pikmin 3, and The Wonderful 101, and I'm already at Gold level! For more info, you can check out [club.nintendo.com/elite-status-gifts.do].<br /><br />If you were holding off on buying a Wii U - like me - well, now is the perfect time to get back into it, especially with Mario Kart just coming out, plus all those great games coming at the end of the year and next year, like the aforementioned upcoming Legend of Zelda.<br /><br />DEFINITELY RECOMMENDED!	0
What is up with this GPS? I thought my bf couldn't read maps and we nearly came to exchanging harsh words over it. It wasn't her - sorry sweetheart - it was the gps. If the street was in Spanish the gps gave the name in English. Por Que?	1
So I'm not sure who's writing these reviews but I don't recommend this product at all. Its cheap, super cheap in fact, it came with damage to a lot of the actual mats and there are way too few end pieces to round off the set.	1
I bought this in case the power goes out.  A friend or ours has been bringing his to our tailgate for 7 years and it works great so when I saw it on sale I had to get one	0
This product sees almost daily use from me and has held up well.  I carry 45 to 50 pound loads often with it when shopping.  I hate carring bags in my hands. This holds a bunch.  It has a lot of adjustment points so be sure and use them to maintaina comfortable load.	0
Have received the speakers 4 days before than the expected date.<br />I'm very happy for the service.<br />Tested the speakers and they sound good.	1
My husband and I remember when this was on tv. Watching this on DVD was definitely taking me back in time to when it was out.	0
Replaced a old disposal with this one.<br /><br />Super easy install. Super Quiet when in use.<br /><br />Lifetime in home warranty is a great extra.	0
I wish they had the Mil reticle with Mil turrets when I had purchased mine. But for the price it is superb glass.<br />The turret tracking is perfect. The knobs seem to &#34;warm up&#34; the first click after not having used it in a long time seems groggy and anemic, but I think it's from the grease that is housed within the scope that needs to move a bit to make it work.	0
My 12 year old daughter wanted a violin just out of the blue. Violins can be very expensive, yet being able to purchase a new one with colors to choose from for a fickle 12 year old girl at this price was an easy decision.<br /><br />The package came quick with everything expected, and the violin was not cheaply made. Yes if she ever learns to play, most likely she'll gravitate to one that will cost more, but for the money every parent can afford to by their kids an instrument to keep them interested in music and learning to play.	1
Just received this mitt in &#60;2 days.  Ordered it for my 8 yr old lefty ball player, who is a back up catcher. As  a lefty it's been limiting since most team gloves are for right handed throw.  This came out of the box soft, a little pounding with  a mallet and it was almost ready to use.  We took it to a local sports store to be steamed and now its really game ready.  My son is thrilled.  The leather seems much softer than the Akadema 1st baseman's glove we got him. This mitt broke in so much faster than expected.  Looking forward to seeing how he does on the field with it.	0
great dvd player works fine.. it is a little loud though.. but all i did was unplug the red cord and there was still sound but not the loud static sound.:)	0
I love my roku and dropped my cable service a week after I hooked it up. Very easy to set up and there are a massive amount of channels to check out. The only thing they could (should) make better is the remote. A QWERTY would be much better than what they have now, or maybe an app for your android.	1
I just finished watching the charming "Bulldog Drummund" series on this set.  What a hoot: funny, sometimes complex, and using the big "tech" of the times: aeroplanes, custom gramophone recordings, even synthetic diamonds! Also lots of Art Deco and appropriate fashions!<br /><br />I also spotted a very young Anthony Quinn, Ray Milland and Leo G. Caroll.  Film and sound quality vary, but the stories are just so much fun. Up next is "The Shadow," complete with more hot tech of the day: and inside look at 1930's radio broadcasting!<br /><br />I don't know if teens will love these, but they are before "my time," and I still enjoy them. The best of this kind of collection I've seen.	0
Bought this for my coffee snob boyfriend and he uses it every day! It works well so far I noticed its starting to get a bit of a white film on the rubber heat protection grip but that has not changed how well this makes coffee.	0
This is a cute toy for babies. Its not too loud and I love the music and noises it makes. The only issue I have is its a bit bulky. My child cant hold it in one hand needs two.	0
I was very excited when I got this last month as it fits my dogs' crate beautifully. However, not excited any longer as there is &#34;fleece shedding&#34; everywhere. Very thin and poorly made. Last straw was today seeing my dog was able to destroy it and remove ALL the filling. Do not recommend it.	0
I recently purchased this game through amazon, I didn't buy it at first because I didn't think it was worth anywhere near 70$ so... I waited for a price drop. I can honestly say after having played on and off for a little over a week, even with the price drop this game is certainly not worth anywhere past 40$. I could write a whole page review concerning this game but many of the things that I would say have been said by other reviewers. Also even with all the reviews I'd gone through and looking at the let's play videos, I still purchased this game; I have been a simmer since TS1 so with the price drop I decided to give this game a try. Not everything in TS4 is awful; their new build mode and the rich vibrant (even though the environmental background might be simulated) neighborhood is welcoming and fresh. I'm not too keen on the loading screens in fact I'm curious to see how that will pan out once expansion packs start its' release. The toddler stage has been completely omitted so the infant "popping" out to a full grown child is honestly ridiculous and hilarious. I also don't dislike or like the pre-color coded options. It works and it doesn't work, meaning some of the design/color options are just terrible and unable to match. I also began to see a growing number of bugs here and there I'm not certain if it was because I kept the game turned on for awhile or because the Sims game as we all know it has an increasing amount of bugs in the first place. I understand that alot of the things that were omitted were to have the game run smoother and it does but it has a design flaw. The game grows on you and it's fun however how long will that last for its' asking price or until the first expansion pack is released? All in all for those of you out there who are on the fence about buying this game like many others have said, buy it for the right price. This base pack certainly lacks content for its' asking price but that is also nothing new with the Sims game franchise,unfortunately. (i.e ts3 eps)    (edited: the gameplay itself is fun and it delivers in that aspect. I've noticed that I enjoy playing ts4 more so than I ever did with ts3)	0
Yacon syrup is way more delicious than I expected! I have been having it on oatmeal, French toast, in my coffee and tea. I am going to try baking with it. It tastes like a mix between brown sugar and caramel and I don't feel guilty eating it which is a huge bonus. I lost 2lbs this week so perhaps it helped. I would definitely recommend trying it.	1
This product is okay if all you're looking for is a hot beverage in the morning. I was very disappointed in the lack of real coffee flavor. Will not buy again.	1
I was really happy with this lamp stylish and good value. They make a great change to my living room and I'm glad I went for a set that complements each other, rather than different lamps. Some of my friends really liked them and are going to get them too.	1
This is very attractive and stylish for a clothes drying rack, though it's not as sturdy as I would have hoped.  It broke after only a few months of very gentle use.	0
Finally replaced the ol bubble but and after andexhaustive search ended up with this samsung model. I can not be happier and would highly reccomend to anyone looking for a new tv.	1
This year I bought a third bottle thinking that last year's malfunction was a one-off. After 5 minutes of spraying I noticed that the bottle contents weren't going down. I tried resetting the on/off a couple of times but it still wasn't delivering the contents.	1
I am a coffee addict. I drink coffee from the moment I wake until the moment I go to sleep. Pretty much everyone in my family is addicted. When my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter sees a mug or cup in a book she says coffee with a big smile. Even though we don't allow her to drink it yet she knows what it is. I like trying new ways of making coffee and having it quick so when I could get this French press at a great price of course I had to. And since I love it so much I wanted to share my thoughts on it. First off it is very pretty. It's is a coffee pot that doesn't take much room and I don't have to hide away. I like that I don't need filters with it because I have accidentally ran out before and almost died when I did. It doesn't take a lot of coffee to fill it up and I can control the strength. It is easy to use also. I highly recommend this to everyone who drinks coffee.	1
This is an odd device. I can't figure out what the intended market is. It seems less useful than a Kindle Fire or an Android tablet, and there is no cost advantage. It does a number of things, but none of them really well. And it has some major flaws. The most obvious is that it has an attached stand that does not fold or adjust and is not removable. This makes it awkward to hold and to carry. It also has a battery life of only 90 minutes, so it works best as a stationary object plugged into an outlet, but then there is no advantage to it being small and light. I found it to be convenient for watching YouTube videos and listening to internet radio, and that is probably the only way I will use it. I tried Skype, but the person with whom I was Skyping said that the picture quality was very poor, so there seems to be a problem with my camera. I also tried using it for photo slideshows, but the resolution was not very good. And finally, it has an insensitive touchscreen which requires pressure for the touch to be effective. It basically feels like old technology at a new technology price. I think there is a lot of room for improvement.	0
Works exactly as I had hopped, it looks great and is powerful, the only drawback is every now and then a seed gets caught and blocks the spout, but all in all it's great	1
Bought a GBA Advance/SP Action Replay back in 2004 and it still works great. There are some things you have to understand when using this: Don't use too many codes all once, your game will freeze, believe me on this. Don't use codes from unauthorized sources, this may cause undesired effects like erasing your save files. Keep it clean and don't drop it, whatever you do. If you take good care of it, it will give you many years of use. I suggest if you must cheat, do so with caution! I've also found out that it won't work with the DS Lite consoles, GBA, SP's only.	0
It is really cute but came apart the first time I watered the plants in my garden.  Guess I expected it to be a little more resilient.  Now I am left with the glasses.	0
The directions were written poorly and couldn't be followed. The display at the bottom of the face cannot be read when minute or hour hand covers it. I am sending it back tomorrow and buying a plain, old-fashioned.	1
I choose this rating because it was just the only one way to explain what I'm feeling. I actually feel like they stole my money, because I ordered this watch on 12AUG2013 and we are already on 29DEC2013 and I didn't receive anything. Please don't do the same mistake as myself...Maybe the watch is as elegant as into their presentation, but the selller's behavior IS NOT. Now, after so many months, I am sure that those guys from FashionMall are thievs. Nobody can change my impression.	0
Product is as described.  Easy install with some mechanical knowledge. I would purchase this product again if I needed it	0
The first few times I tried it, my hair was covered in tacky film. Rinsing with vinegar did not work. However, I followed the hard water tips on Liggett's website, putting a little baking soda in a large tupperware and filling that with warm water and using that to saturate my dry hair in the shower and it has worked just fine since. You can use regular water for competing the lather and rinsing. Worked well as is in NYC and VA. I think the bar has best results when your hair has more natural oils in it, so I've been brushing with a boar bristle brush to distribute oils at night and before washing. Have been able to stretch out time between shampoos to a few days rather than every other.	0
I am really particular about what towels I use on my car, mostly because I had a really bad experience once with a horrible cloth and a beautiful car... it wasn't pretty. So when I bought this I was really careful at first, but it turns out my worries were for nothing! This towel is incredible and does the best job of any drying towel I've tried! It dries my car really fast, and it doesn't leave any lint or streaks! Plus we've actually used it in a few places inside the house and it does a great job here as well! These cloths are definitely worth a try for any car!	1
I just recently ordered these about a week ago and just received them in the mail.  THESE ARE NOT THE SAME AS THE ONE IN THE DESCRIPTION.  They are flimsy and instead of being chrome, it is like a duct tape silver color.  It looks a bit 3D in the picture , but mines are flat and looks like something i can buy at Wal-Mart.  Also the description says 3M tape on the back, that is false as well.  I am so dissatisfied that I called them with the card they sent me to attempt to ask them if they were aware of problem that it doesn't match the description online ... the response I received from the lady that spoke to me was .. "SO DO YOU WANT A REFUND?" .. this makes me more upset because there was no proper answer given or customer service given to me besides telling me to ship it back but its going to cost me about the same to ship it back for a measly 12 dollars i spent.  Instead of shipping it back and getting that money back, I rather type up this review and be more satisfied that no one else makes anymore purchases from these guys because I am damn sure there items does not match item descriptions.  So PLEASE BEWARE AND BE CAREFUL, don't waste your hard earned money on cheats like this.  Honestly those positive comments seem to good to be true, even though i was betting on them to be real, but this is the internet and those comments might be from this company making alias creating those positive comments themselves.  If I am able to take time out of my life to type this out, I appreciate anyone that read these before they buy, because of genuine people like me take pride in where my money is spent.	0
I already have the older Trendnet wireless camera that is just a straight cam with no pan/tilt/zoom for several years which have been very stable and dependable on my wifi network.<br /><br />To the new PTZ Trendnet camera, first off, set up was incredibly easy! I plugged in to the network then plugged the power in. I used NMAP to scan for the device and found the IP. Entered the IP into the browser then it went through the steps to setup. During the setup flow, a step will ask you to create a username and password for cloud access, this will let you access the camera from anywhere in the world.<br /><br />The monitoring page is nice, it gives you an option to use Active-x or Java. Controls are a bit laggy but not horrible. Picture quality is decent, but the Zoom option of the camera is full optical zoom which doesn't work very well. I've played with cameras that had awesome zoom, but the price point is alot higher.<br /><br />The camera makes alot of noises when panning, I wish it was a bit quieter.<br /><br />There are more features on this camera that I have not delved into that I plan on doing soon, but for now, I got the camera working well, so far it has been very stable.<br /><br />My total camera setup at home is 3 Foscams and 2 Trendnets. So far, I have have been happy with the Foscams after plenty of adjustments, if the Trendnet was a bit cheaper, I would most likely convert all to Trendnet as my original Trendnet cam have been super stable.	0
Exactly as advertised. They're safety pins in various sizes.Safe for babies. Can't complain here. Thank you!	1
Simple little product, superior for cyano glue application on detailed models.  Just the right amount, easy to get to hard to reach places.	0
Perfect size for your purse or carry on bag.  Not to big or clunky, holds all your personal credit cards, passport and other travel documents safe.  Totally recommended!	0
These beans were very economical and the seller was extremely prompt in getting them to me. They came to me fresh and there were quite a few beans in the package. I feel that this is an excellent product and the seller is superb - would definitely buy again!	1
This is a very cheap product.  Threading was too big for &#34;ALL&#34; of my 1/4&#34; jacks and I am forced to throw the 3 mounts that I bought away.  Material is of cheap nickel material which scratches easility and is fairly disappointing.  Will not purchase this product again and I advise you to do the same.	0
I love this tv. Have it wall mounted in my basement.  One of my favorite things is the color is great whether the lights are on or off. LEDs are awesome! I have owned this TV for 2 years without issues.  I'm not a big fan of the smart hub, however I do not use it as I have a PS3 that basically performs the same functions as the smart hub would.  The remote that comes with this TV is an odd brick shaped thing with a keyboard on one side and a normal remote on the other. I don't use the remote for anything but changing the source input, the volume, the channels and the on/off function. The rest of the remote seems unnecessary and large.	0
The DLC codes can only be redeemed once. So do not purchase this game used expecting a fresh download. I blame Konami on this one. Would have been easier to keep it buy gamer tag instead of limiting it. But then again, DLC is the worst thing to happen to the gaming world in regards to consumers.	0
I love these shoes even though they are wide for me and did not have in narrow so I had to return.  So sad!!!!	0
I got this book at my local library.<br /><br />There were only a couple of things keeping this from being a absolutely perfect book. The first would have been more information about his relationship with his two children. And the second would have been more information about the relationship with his wife, Nell.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is almost like being a friend of Wooden's during most of his life. It had quite a bit on information about his early life, his time at Purdue and the period at ISU, etc. I live on the south side of Indianapolis and worked for about a year as a pharmacist at the hospital in Martinsville. One of my best friends from Westfield High School was a big fan of his growing up - had his success pyramid on his bedroom wall, etc.<br /><br />Since I played football, track and baseball, I was mainly interested in his teams always wining the NCAA men's Basketball championship, seemingly every year. I lived barely a hour from Purdue while growing up. Once married I live barely an hour from where he grew up. When I attended my one year at ISU I was unaware that he had coached there for 3 years. And I graduated from Butler University and I knew Tony Hinkle quite well. I grew up with Bobby Plump and Hoosier Hysteria.<br /><br />But I never knew of his glory days playing at Purdue nor of his barnstorming days in the early pro leagues.<br /><br />This book is rich in detail and I highly recommend this book to nearly everyone. You don't have to be a sports fan to enjoy this book. Coach Wooden is quite simply an icon in Indiana as well as the sports world. They put up a ugly (to me anyway) statue in downtown Indianapolis a few years ago in his honor. It depicts him crouched down in a time-out huddle with only the legs of his players as he is giving them directions.<br /><br />I would rate this book a very high 9.25 to 9.75 out of ten!!!	0
I really like the look of this xbox 360 bundle, and have always been a star wars fan. But even if I wasn't I would still buy this bundle because I like the look so much.	1
I do recommend these, I use them for all the winter cloths extra cloths, coats, and linens. I like these and am impressed with these.	1
I'm sorry the other reviewer had bad luck.. My Washburn must have been built by someone conscientious ..  Mine sounds like the deep Delta unplugged. Its very playable and mine was set up perfectly for slide/finger picking..The cut-out allows for traveling a good distance up the neck. I was concerned that the &#34;electronics&#34; would interfere with the acoustic sound, of course I can't know what it would sound like without the lipstick pickup but I don't think it could get much better.  Its a good size guitar with weight giving  it a solid feel.  The neck shape is perfect for me. its a little stout and for me that's a very good thing.. speaking of the pick-up.. I read from another source of reviews that the pickup is a bit weak.. I agree, but luckily for me I have some good compressor/preamps and running into my ProSonus &#34;channel one&#34; this is not a problem in fact I can dial in a sound almost like its unplugged which is connected D I to my DP 32. .. At the present time I have 3 resonators besides the Washburn. A tri-cone, a spider and a biscuit.  even though the other 3 are much  higher in the price department, the Washburn is by far the best.  I  have no reason to &#34;gush&#34; over this guitar, frankly I was quite sure I would be disappointed and send it back, but the opposite is the case, I can't put it down.  I've had my share of junk guitars that I have returned but this one is definitely a keeper.  Lastly, it should be said that one needs to know how to get that delta sound.. I don't mean to be over dramatic but playing delta is someone of an art form, it certainly helps to have a good sounding guitar but you need to work on this style.. finger picking/slide. I know I'm still working at it. **UPDATE** I use this guitar mostly for busking with a Roland Wedge battery powered amp.  I sounds veery&#34;bluesy&#34; when mixing in the electric with the acoustic sound. The play-ability is really great.. plays like an electric... The neck is a little beefy which is great for me.  There are obviously more expensive resonator and I own a few but this guitar for all its little  cosmetic faults, is my favorite guitar.  Its a Heavy guitar, built like a brick but the neck is so perfect for me.. I  finger pick.. don't know what is would be like with flat-picking.  running it thru the wedge, adjusting the volume and tone it sounds perfect when I play Robert Johnsons &#34;Crossroads&#34; When I recorded a demo, I miked the amp with a dynamic and miked the the guitar with a ribbon mike.. blending the amped sound with the acoustic resonator sound, well it makes me sound like I play better then I really do.. can't ask for more then that...   Another Update.. inre: strings.. Testing strings has been an eye opener.  I have found that this guitar using the pickup sounds alot like early Muddy Waters.. Can't be Satisfied, I feel like Going Home etc.  I tried 4 brands.. 12-54 gauge.. Thet all sounded good acostically but didn't make the grade for electric.. .. I ended up with a perfect string for electric but although the sound is Delta acoustically, sounds real goodI haven't tried miking it.. that's for later.. The Martin M14080/20 bronze.. 12-054 does the trick.. Mogami cable from the guitar to a low powered class A amp back to a pre/compression then LowZ to the recorder This guitars using slide and fingers sounds very bluesy, the slide, as an example, sounded great with my recording of the Alternate take of R.J. Crossroads...I don't know if I mentioned it above.. this guitar is HEAVY.. heaviest guitar I ever owned and like you guitarist, I have had many guitars over the years.. its a beast.. more later.                                                                                                Update This guitar is really &#34;broken in&#34; now.. Its been awhile since I owned it and I noticed another wasn't happy with his.  I think he got a bad deal.. but for anyone thinking about this guitar, should really consider making the purchase. I've got &#34;blending&#34; the pickup (into my dp-32) and acoustically I have a mid priced ribbon mike. that seems to really like the R45.Placement of the mike obviously is important. this method records sweet with a little edge.  By itself, (I have other resonators. This isn't the loudest or the softest) (depending how you hit the strings).  I finger pick and slide (using a glass slide) and the sound of the guitar alone is sweet and a bit edgy.  Pliability is great, especial;ly with the cut out.If I do a little street playing I have The Wedge by Roland which is battery powered and although its solid state its still has the attributes I already mentioned.  One thing is for sure, it sure is the heaviest guitar I ever owned.  Some musicians expect to get the guitar out of the box and sound like there in the delta.. but you need to coax that sound from a guitar when playing blues...	0
i picked this up for my grandfather cause he loves listening to his old vinyl albums and didn't want to part from his vintage player i hooked it up reall quick and it improved the music volume and made it clear.	1
Good quality headphones for my young son.  You just have to be very careful with the folding hinges, they can break easy if not handled with care.	0
Good price, good delivery and very good gel for a perfect hold. This is the best gel I have ever used in 30 years.	0
The size of the infuser is perfect for a 4 cup pot of tea.<br /><br />The small straining holes allow for using some of the finest tea leaves.  I have found that other infusers allow for the leaves to escape and float in the tea-pot, requiring additional straining prior to serving.  This stainless steel product  is high quality and easy to clean.  The silicon handle and lid are well constructed and securely attach to the infuser. The product comes with a drip tray that could also be used to cover a tea-cup for warmth.<br /><br />It was a joy to use this product this past week.  Instead of jumping up to my hot-pot every 15 minutes, I simply prepare my water, make a pot of tea and continue with my computer work.	1
I purchased two of them and they have worked wonderfully with no problems.  They are brighter than other night lights, save electricity by not staying on all the time and are extremely durable.	0
This backpack is cute. However very poorly made. My daughter has had it less than 3 weeks and not only is the stitching coming undone on the top...both sides leaving  3 inch holes, but the plastic brace that is supposed to keep it standing upright has cracked and broken off.  NOT worth it at any price!!	0
Marvel T2 Wireless is a really effective product, I used this to my samsung phone and the cradle stand is also securely holding my samsung phone and also made up of highest quality materials so it's really worth it buying!!	1
I bought this product as a gift for my best friend. It's his birthday soon. And I know he will be happy with this because he's a guitar collector. It's a cute pendant. I will buy one for myself.	1
It made me scared to even try it.  Label was half torn off and syrup leaking every where.  Label looks like the picture like someone printed it off their printer at home, barely stuck it on a bottle and sent it out.	1
This kit is amazing! My kids love it and they've tattooed themselves and started asking me as well to make one.<br /><br />I love the fact that they can express their creativity and have fun at the same time.<br /><br />It is not suited for small children as they can swallow parts. This is clearly mentioned on the pack.	1
Just what I wanted. Works great, very comfortable. I highly recommend these headphones. They are priced just right.<br />The headphone was recommended to me by a friend, now she's my BFF.	0
in line with expectations and offered , arrived at the date indicated , and in excellent condition , very happy with the product.	0
I bought this for a SIIG 2 port firewire expresscard (model NN-EC2012-S1) I have for my laptop. Before I got this, I was doing a live recording one day with a mixer via firewire and suddenly lost the connection after a couple of hours (had to reboot the mixer to get the connection back). So I bought this power adapter and have since used the card under the same circumstances as when I lost the connection, but with the power adapter it hasn't happened.	0
Love it! Love the characters! Love the writing style! Great summer read. Kept me interested and I can really relate to Clare. Well done!	0

Did this unit meet my needs.... ?<br />It EXCEEDED it !<br />One word............  &#34; INCREDIBLE &#34;<br /><br />But Braun made the unit....so how can anyone complain.<br />it looks nice and it's the Ferrari of Electric Shavers.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed!	0
Just what I needed! I purchased a used Bumbo seat and wanted a cover for it, this fit the bill perfectly. The colors are nice, and it's very cute. But mostly, it will provide the barrier I wanted.	0
Really Fantastic..!! This remote is working very well without any problem. And the buttons are making feeling comfortable. The compatibility with my LCD TV works fine and seamlessly. Recommended..!!!	1

The instructions that came with the Shield were very complete.  But I have a few comments you must have the screen you are putting this on must be clean.  There is always a problem of static electricity you must make sure that you drain it off other wise hair and dust will spoil the installation.  I wiped the surface(kitchen table)before putting the tablet on with a clean damp cloth before starting. I took off the long sleeve shirt I was wearing.  I wiped off my face and arms with a damp cloth.  Using most of the spray on the Shield that came with the unit, helps to reposition the Shield after it is in place(for the holes in the shield to line up with camera and light sensor).  Also wet the surface of the Shield after it is in place to help the squeegee slide over the surface to remove the water and air bubbles from under the Shield.  Fits great.	0
this is just a great movie to have and each time I watch this move I end up crying, I love it the story the plot is simply just amazing... im just a huge fan of this movie	1
Product seems good, but &#34;3 count&#34; does NOT mean 3 bear sprays, but one so &#34;1 count&#34; --Amazon fixed the problem -- thanks	0

Jerry Seinfeld, Tracy<br /><br />Kathleen Tracy is an entertainment journalist who wrote other biographies. This 1998 book was written after the series ended. Jerry Seinfeld chose to end the series after nine years, it wasn't due to falling ratings. [The book says there was criticism about the stories.] This book covers Jerry's life from childhood to a national television star in 19 chapters. It has an `Episode Guide' to the 179 episodes and an `Index'. It tells about the stand-up comedians and the business of comedy in the 1980s. The show ran from May 1990 to May 1998. Was it "a show about nothing" as some said? It portrayed (or mocked) the lives of the personal servants of the rich and their problems. Did many of its audience identify with these characters and their problems? Did they know people like them? Or was it because it dealt with topics censored from the usual TV comedies? [I was not a fan and seldom watched the shows.]<br /><br />One example of its influence is on page 133 where an executive employee was fired for discussing an episode. A wrongful termination lawsuit awarded him $26 million. Euphemisms may work in a controlled TV show but have unwanted effects in the real world. Was this double-entendré part of the appeal of the show? Episodes dealt with the events of everyday life but looked at them from a humorous viewpoint. Can parking in a handicap-only spot generate humor? Its not funny to a handicapped person who needs that spot! Dealing with topics not usually discussed is certainly daring. It also dealt with ordinary problems, life finding your car in a huge parking garage. [Write down the location on a piece of paper.] It warned about the need to safeguard your financial records ("The Truth"). [Use a copying machine.]<br /><br />Jerry was born in 1954 and spent a lot of time watching TV (Chapter 1). [That TV station in NYC (p.3) now shows reruns of "Seinfeld" at night after prime time.] He graduated from Queens College in 1976 with a double major in theater and communication arts; then started as a stand-up comic (Chapter 2). The 1980s saw hundreds of comedy clubs started (Chapter 3). [There is a lot of details about the comedy business here.] Jerry appeared on "The Tonight Show" in 1981. His career grew (Chapter 4). He was a clean comic. Jerry could earn as much as "the mid-five figures per week" (p.48). Jerry built up a car collection (p.51). [Some inner hunger?] Jerry got together with Larry David to work on an NBC show about conversation (Chapter 5). Characters were based on people they knew. NBC ordered four more shows (p.63). Jerry's job as performer, producer, and writer was a heavy workload. The remaining fifteen chapters continue the story of this successful comedy show. Chapter 14 tells Jerry's idea of a perfect girlfriend. Read Chapter 15 for more details.<br /><br />Can this show ever be copied? For what reason? Shows are aimed at the 18 to 49 year olds because they have the most disposable income and spend their money more freely (p.111). Would you like these characters as neighbors or friends or co-workers? Too self-absorbed? What has changed after 15 years? Chapter 18 explains the economics of show business regarding salaries ad advertising. What does this say about the audience for TV shows?	0
These worked really great for rekeying Schlage locks. They are the nice original keys, not the cheap imported ones. They even have the numbers on the keys, so it makes it so much easier know which tumblers to use. I only had one repeat set of keys. I saved so much time by using these.	1
Would not fit over closet door have to screw on the door.Notice the bottom of the mirror won't close don't know if it's because of the long necklaces on the bottom???Wouldhavepreferred small pockets for the earrings and less space for rings.	1
Looks like plastic and behave like it. It is not flexible at all could be plastic or something else but not leather.	1
I bought these for my husband. He says they are very warm and comfy. They seem like they will wear well. Although they are expensive for slippers if they do hold up they will be good value for money. If I can find them in my size I'm getting a pair for myself.	1
We bought this few days back .this is excellent. Specially browser functionality flash support.<br />I can watch Online serials ,Movies anything.<br />You tube and Netflix work too.<br /><br />Its now available with update version 4.3 .	0
Candy Pink PlayStation controller- Love the color. I basically had to buy my own since the BF kept breaking his controllers from getting frustrated from playing video games. I had to make sure he didn't confuse his controller with mine so had to go with pink.	0
This bar is so simple to hang, a one year old can do it. Just hang over door. Nice weight with great a good design.	0
I really got this hanging rack becuase my skis would fit in it perfectly. But In general it's a good solid rack. Nice strong solid metal can hold heavy items.	1
Perfect for some one who just bought a GoPro. The kit consists of very useful tools if you are trying to make a POV video. It's at a good price and helps get your work done. Wouldn't recommend if u intended to use them in extreme environments and conditions such as jets and harsh waters. All in all a good buy !!!	1
I received this case a few days ago and I would like to mention a little about it.<br />I feel very satisfied and impressed with the quality of its material. It is very slim and supports my S5. It is different from my previous case which was full of embellishments but didn't protect my phone but this case has taken all the worries away. People should give it a go.	1
Lost my Sony Camera charger. I'm really glad I found this one at such an amazing price. It was shipped speedily and the performance is outstanding. Very satisfied.	1
Love it! Such cute packaging, the curler itself fits so nice in my hand and is very easy to use. It's been hard for me to find eyelash curlers that fit my eye shape in the past but this one is perfect! Highly recommended :)	1
I tried about 30 different toothpastes before finding this one. It's by far my favorite. It's minty with a bite that I can feel.<br /><br />I ditched the major commercial toothpastes because they contained a lot of chemicals and additives like colorants and artificial sweeteners. I hated Tom's of Maine because of their metal tubes. Hard to squeeze all of it out once it starts emptying out and sometimes the tube would puncture, leaking toothpaste everywhere.<br /><br />Dessert Essence I also didn't like. The one I bought was sweetened with stevia and had a very unpleasant strong after taste.<br /><br />Nature's Gate also makes a toothpaste gel one that tastes really bad. Get this one!	0
Got it from warehouse store, basically same price (with tax) except Amazon offers free shipping (with Prime) and basic unpacking and setup. I needed the easy return option just in case, though.<br /><br />At first we were annoyed. My wife commented that the picture looked strange. It was the dreaded "soap opera effect", and this TV does not have a specific setting to turn off "smooth motion."<br /><br />After some research, I tried setting Game Mode on, and that fixed it. Whew! It was quite unpleasant watching Dark Knight Rises like it was filmed in the As The World Turns studio.<br /><br />Thank goodness for Game Mode, because this is an unbeatable price for its features. A smart TV which lets you use Amazon video, Netflix, Vudu, Hulu Plus, YouTube, some Yahoo stuff, Twitter, Skype (cam needed), FaceBook, MGo, Rhapsody ... no browser, but there is a VGA input. (You'll need to let it update to get all these apps.)<br /><br />And passive 3D, to boot. It may not look as high-res as active - from four or five feet away you may see thin horizontal lines - but it'll do.<br /><br />There are inputs aplenty: 4 HDMI, cable/antenna, component, VGA, ethernet, USB ...<br /><br />Connecting a soundbar: HDMI 1  is the ARC port. That lets you connect a soundbar to it via HDMI and control the volume through it (you can connect the video input directly to another HDMI port on the TV, rather than through the soundbar HDMI IN). If you're connecting a Samsung soundbar (HW-E450, in my case), you need to turn AnyNet+ on for this to work. Go to TV settings, turn CEC ON, System Audio Control ON. Try the Device Discovery. You probably want to go to Audio settings and turn TV speakers OFF. The video may vanish, but just go back and select that input. That should do it!<br /><br />You can adjust backlight settings manually only if you turn off the Ambient Light Sensor in advanced picture settings..<br /><br />Haven't gotten the ideal picture yet ... cinema mode is darker, standard mode seemsto warm, vivid mode gives splotchy faces and skin (darker, pink patches on yellowish skin).<br /><br />Had an issue getting Netflix to play video. Called tech support and they resolved it. I've called them a couple of times and they were actually quite helpful.<br /><br />All told, I think we'll be keeping it.<br /><br />Update: sometimes Netflix fails and it goes nuts - the remote stops working. Try this:<br /><br />1- Power off TV<br />2- Unplug TV from outlet<br />3- Press and hold in the power button on the TV for 30 seconds (while it is unplugged from the wall)<br />4- Release the power button<br />5- Plug in the TV in<br />6- Power on the TV<br /><br />Next:<br /><br />Un pair Remote :<br /><br />1. Press the "Q"  "P" and "SPACE" button on remote at the same time for 5 seconds.<br />2.  Take out both batteries.<br />3. Press all the buttons on the remote, one at a time (including the keyboard). (You can skip this step sometimes)<br />4. Put batteries back in.<br />5. Test the remote<br /><br />Re Pair remote :<br />1. Press the Green Button and RED Record button for 10 seconds.<br />2. It should now be paired.<br />3. Test out the remote	0
I teach.  So, I freeze all day during the cold spells so that we can keep the utility bills down and save money due to budget cuts.  I bought these boots to wear at school on those really cold days.  (It may sound weird, but even with multiple socks in regular shoes my toes get cold.)  I was able to wear them all day and teach on my feet with no problem or discomfort.  It also did the job and kept my toes warm!  Score!  I wish that I had ordered a size up.  The room in the toe part of the boot fits fine, but they would have been a lot easier to get on and off if I had ordered up a size I believe without being uncomfortable in the foot area.	0
I freaking love this movie.  Edward Norton is a great actor and his role in this movie is perfect.  I can watch this movie over and over.  It will never get old to me.  Thanks.	1
Assembly very easy. In my opinion, the final product looks very good and the quality of the item is very good. Adjustable both in longitudinal and transverse  but very strong and table. Thank you.	1

It's a lot of fun! Made simply and strong I don't see how this little beauty can not last a life time. Gooddarting all.	0
Great price, and work perfect with my Optoma GT360 projector. Charge fast and last long on a single charge, better than the ones I bought for $200 (2 pack) – wish I would have waited or looked around.	1
My dog loves to catch this. It is very easy on her mouth.  You just have to make sure not to let other dogs play tug-of-war with it.	0
great welder for the money come with the battery installed .I have had it for one year now with no problems just hit the key and it starts right up	0
I've used this tuner for both my acoustic guitar and banjo for a year now and like them a lot.  We got this one for my wife's mandolin.  It's small, barely noticeable from the front and easily visible from the back.  I understand it can be a tight fit on some headstocks, it's snug on my 12 fret slot-head guitar due to the buttons pointing straight down but it works ok for me.  The accuracy is as good or better than any I've used.<br />Pros:<br />Accurate<br />Cheap<br />Easy to see in daylight or dark<br />Good battery life<br />It's always there, you don't have to hunt for a tuner.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I wish it would turn the tuner buttons for me!	0
Quality is not up to par as this product is something from 2003.  Come on Sylvania, it is 2014, make a quality product that is for this day and age.  It does the job, but, come on...	0
Looks very nice, seems to be very well constructed. Size was as listed. What more can you say about a belt. Very happy with my purchase.	1

save your money. if you think it is hard to put a screen saver on a cell phone with no air bubbles try something 20 times as big.	0
I wore it to my friend's wedding last weekend. I received many compliments on it. It is completely covered with rhinestones at the surface. So brilliant and glistening!! I put my iPhone, credit card, keys and lipsticks in the bag. It still have room for other small essentials.It has a long strap hidden inside. You can use it as a clutch hand bag as well as a shoulder bag. I highly recommend this handbag to anyone who wants to shine on a special day. I am very satisfied with this purchase!!	1
This is an excellent product. I was starting to worry about my dog, he is just too lazy, so I though there was something wrong with him, I took him to the vet and he told me he was fine, he just needed a few vitamines.<br /><br />I bought this product for him and there has been a lot of improvements, he is more active, with more energy, he responds when I call him.<br /><br />Thanks for these supplements, for real, you guys changed how my dog behaves with me.	1
*****  I really do like this jam funnel. I don't use it for jam.    It is pretty sturdy for a plastic funnel. The top diameter measures just under 5 inches. The funnel is 1 1/4 (1 and 2/8) inches across on the inside, and about 1 5/8 on the outside. So this means that the plastic thickness adds 3/8 inches to whatever it fits INTO.    I was tired of funnels that get so skinny at the end. I have a hard time getting powder through those. And the ultra-wide canning funnels don't fit into the jars I have because they are too big. So this funnel is incredibly handy--kind of an in-between compromise between a regular funnel and a canning funnel.    Recommended, nice product!  *****	0
Perfectly alright! Though the hid made in china but I am sure kensun made this as per usa market stander. Kensun assured their quality among many others Chinese hid in the market. specially the blast is more heavier and the brghtness is just double if you compare with other non brand Chinese hid! I also called customer service twice  for the right size for my suv and found guys are very good in service !	1

I have been playing guitar for 8 years now and have always wanted to dive into the blues genre. I can play mostly anything on the guitar but after watching the blues dvd in particular it has helped me in all genres of guitar playing. This DVD is very easy to learn and the apply the new techniques to playing. I can go at my own pace and speed up if i need to. Great buy and the other DVDS were great for me to freshen up on some stuff i learned years earlier.	1
It was a gift for my adult daughter, she had one when she was little and carried it everywhere, so I surprised her with another, she was very pleased.	0
This is a great game, I bought it used from Amazon warehouse deals, but I wasnt told that the online code was not included, tried to save a few dollars by buying used, but had to buy it again from EA, would have been cheaper to buy new!!	0
I lost my stuffed Rescue toy, and was clearly upset when I did. Then, I had the brilliant idea to look on Amazon. This is the cutest little toy ever and if you get it for any child or dog lover I can guarantee they will love it!	0
Not a lot to say except:  it works!  Makes it SO much easier to tune my violins when the pegs don't  want to stick.  This gives the grip needed.	0
I have a black iPhone 6 so I have the black case on. I have dropped it once in the kitchen and there was no damage at all done to the phone.Very nice case. One of the best rugged cases I've ever used. I feel confident that this case will protect my phone very well. The three different colored back plates are a nice way to customize the case for each individual.	1
The construction is much better than I had expected. The watch itself is solid, and the strap is strong and doesn't feel like it will fall off. I often work across multiple timezones - so this watch (with the two analog displays) is perfect for me. I'm a real user who really purchased this item (Live in Oregon, USA). I highly recommend this watch.	1
I love this stuff. It doesn't make your hair greasy like other oils do. I put it in my wet hair and then dry it. Then when it's dry I add a little more to the ends. As long as I don't apply it to my roots it never looks greasy.	0
I have been using it for at about 3 months. Overall, it is ok. It is not excellent but not bad either.	0
It was okay. I was pleased to see that the video wasn't boring and the people on it didn't seem like robots like most exercise videos I have tried. The music was good as well. The DVD itself was very inspirational, I just think it's more than I am ready to commit to. So, I am taking points off for that. t contains 24 exercises that work on your shoulders, abs, obliques, legs, and glutes. I have no doubt that the program works, but it has to be something you're committed to. It's not something you can do for like 5 minutes a day and end up with a dancer's body. It's a satisfying, total body workout. A friend of mine used the system and she's looking amazing. I just don't have the discipline. So, if you're dedicated, then I'm sure you will look great. If it's a half-hearted attempt then there's probably another option.	1
After I had my baby, I was very concerned with the weight I had put on. I didn't get the time to exercise. This slimming belt helped me reduce a lot of weight.	1
Product is &#34;okay&#34;. Very small container. Doesn't seem to have any positive effect on wiry mustache hair other than hold it down if enough wax used. The Old Butch Hair Wax as effective in that role... and a lot cheaper for a large jar!	0
If you get the wrong size the company is very reasonable and helps you out! They come small so get a size larger than normally would. Other than that the company is great!	1
The toner seems okay but I have not used it much at this point.  With the new drum unit in place the printing is extremely faded.	0
I have tried all sorts of Coffee pouches and this one so far worked best, it keeps them well and I have no complaints, wasn't even going to review but then I figured it may help someone one so why not.	1
I love the screen, very beautiful and functional. But no matter how I set it on end, it keeps falling over, and the screen has already ripped in a couple of spots.	0
This product is very decent in look and worth it buying from amazon. I recommend every parents to buy this watch on their kids bday.	1
I ordered this because I had the standard issue, over the shoulder laptop bag which was bulky, heavy and horrible. This bag looks better and the handles are very well attached so that I have no thought of them pulling away -- which is an important feature to me. Drawback is that there is very little room inside for other things.	1
Very nice clock, the hands can be seen in the dark. It isn't completely quiet but it is quiet. Very sleek looking and keeps accurate time.	0
I read an article once about using toothpaste to clear the fog on headlights. A mechanic friend of mine recommended it too. But after two applications and much scrubbing, it didn't improve one bit. My first thought was that the fog was on the inside and thus impossible to remove, but when I came across the 3M 39098 kit, I figured I'd give it a try.<br /><br />And I'm glad I did. My headlights are now spotless.<br /><br />The process is a bit lengthy; took me over an hour and a half, but my lenses were really bad, so I spent extra time sanding. Each step smoothed out the lenses a little bit more, but the first step was the most important; getting all the staining off so that the lense looked cloudy rather than murky. The instructions are really easy to follow, and provide visual examples so you know what to look for. The only thing I recommend is adding extra tape around tight edges because I ended up scratching my paint by mistake (got a bit wild with the sandpaper).<br /><br />Overall, a very good experience.<br /><br />Note: The kit has enough in it for two headlights -- one car. There were a few things left over, but if you want to do a second car, I recommend a second kit.<br />Note 2: This only works on plastic headlights, not glass.	0
I bought several of these packs of cubes, with the intention of creating a bigger arrangement than was shown in the advertisement. I actually used 2 packs to create a 3 X 3 arrangement of cubes. There was one grid and several attachers left over from that arrangement. I was surprised at how easily it went together, you just need to put on constant pressure until you hear the click with each attachment. And it was quite sturdy in a 3 X 3 arrangement, sturdy enough to be constructed in one room and moved to another with no problems of pieces coming apart.	0
I had a old Vito from the '80s one child is using and is as good as new minus a little cork on the mouth piece.  Still works and plays nice.  Plastic is in great condition.<br /><br />Another child wanted to learn the clarinet so we picked this instrument up.  It works, plays fine.  Good for a student to learn on.  Good price.  The only problem was the mouth piece was not smooth at the top where the reed sits and your mouth touches.  We picked up another mouth piece and that fixed the problem.  Child was able to play without hurting their mouth anymore.<br /><br />That said, comparing my old Vito with this instrument really shows the difference in manufacturing practices, for the worse.  The Vitto was a student instrument and it looks so good compared to this brand.  The Vito is easier to play.  You don't need to force as much air through to get a good, clear tone.  The tone of this clarinet is deeper, need to adjust mouth and breath to get be in tune with electric tuner teacher uses.  Not a noticeable problem unless you have another clarinet to compare against.<br /><br />If you aren't certain your child will stick with this instrument, go for it.<br />Beginner, go for it,then upgrade as they advance.  Better instruments do make a difference in sound.	1
The order arrived on time, and was very pretty, but I thought it would have more sparkle in person of course like in the picture. Over all I liked it.	0
this was a gift for my neighbor who is like a second mom. She and my father talked alot about Chinese food, and other stuff. but i gave this to her early as a present . she loved it .	0
I love my kick mats! I was so tired of cleaning the back of my seats. This mats are easy to install and are made of nice quality material. They wipe clean so nicely. They are truly a lifesaver for my seat upholstery. Definitely a must for anyone with children!	1
I totally recommend http://fave.co/1c3G1er  They look real from a distance, but I think when you're really close to them, they look basic. We hung our high. The stickers you get here are a nice touch.  http://fave.co/1bL2PyO  The only thing I would add to these is a battery for a red LED light. I had a camera as a kid that had 2 AA batteries that actually moved when it sensed motion... battery lasted over a year. I also recommend drilling a hole in the base of the mount, to feed the fake cord through on these, to make it look like the cord is being wired into the house. The fake cord as packaged (at least in mine) was just hanging off the camera.  My mom lives in a pretty small neighboorhood, though it is close to a few highschools. Every year when school gets out it seems like the neighborhoods around there get small break-ins, nothing major. Her house had her window broken into, stole small amount of money and that's it. I purchased these for her to place around the outside of her house, and the back garage.  She got this one first   http://fave.co/1bL2ufF  I got a set of these a few months ago and they are great. I came back to order more but they have changed the design! The older ones were actual casings from real cameras. This new design looks incredibly fake and too &#34;plasticky&#34;. Also, how many real cameras have the cheesy flashing red light? Almost none. If you do buy these, at least don't put in batteries for the light to flash...that's a dead giveaway that they are fake cameras. Unfortunately I will have to find another brand that isn't so obviously fake.  Side note...a little trick I like to do is to label my FOUR cameras 1, 4, 7, 9 etc...if someone is sniffing around and they can only find four, they will expect that the others have to be somewhere that they can't find.	1
Camera was new in  package. Everything was included as advertised. Camera functions very well, great photos. Lots of room to grow with this semi-professional camera.	1
Perfect pair of speakers for basic computer needs. Super-fast shipping and cheap too! You can't go wrong at this price. Positive - good investment - economy in the bucket - safe bet to buy	1
This "8 GB Metal Gun USB Drive" is perfect for any firearm enthusiast! The metal pistol is a little larger than it appears in the product picture, but the full size USB connector is a good indication of the actual size.<br /><br />The all metal gun actually provides decent protection for the flash drive that stores in the "grip" like a pistol magazine. The drive is held in fairly securely by friction and is easily removable when needed. This does not appear to be the fastest USB drive I have tried, but it works just fine for documents and pictures.<br /><br />The drive is a great novelty that has practical functionality as well!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH	0
Arrived very quickly, and seems to be of good quality. It was a gift for a friend, who really liked it. Thanks!	0
I really like these cufflinks; they are classy and stand out. I get a lot of good comments on them whenever I wear them. The metal is actually pretty hefty and solid steel, they "feel" like good quality. The wood looks very nice in person.	1
I really love this shower speaker. It was very easy to setup and link it to my Android HTC smartphone. IT sounds great in my  my bathroom and it has enough stamina to run for more than 1 day. However, the design is not as beautiful as it seems to be in the pictures which are posted here.	1
I thought this was a great buy for the price. I love the size of this rolling duffle and it has great pocket space, however it does not roll. The wheels just slide across the floor no matter what the surface. I was a gift to my daughter and she is really disappointed that we will have to be replacing it.	1
I gave them 3 stars because they are clear but they do not look durable like the photo online, they are a little weak but they slow my child down from opening doors unnoticed. Yes, I would recommend them to someone else.	0
I've always liked ream products,  but this one fell short. In order to load or unmount the phone you have to use both hand's.  There older style that had the spring loaded jaws on top was quicker and held the phone just as secure as this new style.	0
Works great too keeping solid time. My dad loves this gift. Especially the artwork design on the back side of the watch	0
This shampoo smells really bad that I can't bear to use it any longer.<br />After trying it just 3 days, I had to give it up because of the foul smell. It smells like gasoline almost.<br /><br />I can't comment on the results because I haven't use it long enough to know.	1
Great quality watch at a great price. bought for everyday wear and so far it has preformed great. Incredible value for a great watch.	0
Ok so I am into biking. The thing is I care about the air I breath and the water I drink. This is the most environmentally unfriendly solution I have ever seen. It just stinks.	1
I really take care about the way I look even when I am carrying my tablet with me. Thanks to this bag I know that my laptop is secure and that I am fitting the latest fashion trends. Absolutely great product!	1
This is great rice, tender when cooked and sticky. But the price is way too expensive. I bought a bigger bag for the nearly same price at the local market. Look around your town for a far more reasonable price.	1
These black crew sox are very poor. They are paper thin, and will probably not last many<br />months. The fit is poor, the elastic does not hold them up, and so all day I'm cinching them back up which is incredibly irritating. The only good thing I can say is that they are cheap.	1
$900 may not be much for a couch, but considering you can get a couch on Amazon for $260, shipping included!!! I did have some basic expectations of this one.<br />It feels REALLY cheap, all around. First time I sat on it I was really unhappy. Guess I am spoiled by memory foam :-(. It looks as cheap as it feels. And why would I get BROWN legs with a gray couch?<br />I would have NEVER purchased this couch, at any price, had I seen it in a show room.....<br />Stuck with it now, at least until it falls apart...that shouldn't be too long from now as I have dogs.	0
The chicken dinner is one of several from Stella and Chew's that I tried after my dog rejected a long line of excellent dog foods. He is healthy and has an excellent appetite but prefers people food. He also likes the beef, lamb and other varieties of this dinner. He looks great and has lots of energy. I'm delighted.	0
It's a good read. I first read this to my child when she was still in the belly, and now, 3 years later, this is her favorite book! A bit unconventional for a kid's storybook, but we like it.	1
The next "Super Food" I guess! 10 lbs in a month and a half! Great price, great product. I would highly recommend this to my friends and family. Thanks State Nutrition!	1
Sara Shepard does it again. Seriously, I'm in love with this series too.<br /><br />If you like PLL, you're most likely going to be a fan of this series as well. SS is able to keep you guessing the whole time, and by the end of the book you only want more. I stumbled across this entirely by accident, and now I'm reading my way through the series. I won't post any spoilers, but it's different...yet the same as PLL. You're going to want to know who did it, but you won't be able to figure it out. The clues will keep you guessing, and the plot twists will make your heart race. You'll love some of the characters, then hate them... and then love them again. It's awesomely fun to read, and I can't wait to get the next one!	0
This saw is the real deal.  Cuts fast and clean and seems to be keeping a sharp edge.  Remember to grab a belt sheath.  They are handy.	0
My neighbor's apartment is infested with roaches. I keep my house clean and I installed these devices. No roaches or ants. I get an occasional fly or a spider but even that is rare. I don't know if they work but I'm not goanna test it by getting rid of them. These will always be in my house.	1
I have two excellent rhyming dictionaries. One is this and the other is [[ASIN:B00FF8SDZ6 Hip Hop Rhyming Dictionary: The Extensive Hip & Rap Rhyming Dictionary for Rappers, Mcs and lyricists]]. These books have every lyres I need. These books are simply the best. I grantee them for any person interested in high quality lyrics and rhymes.	1
I really do love the fact that I bought this product. I bought it for my husband's birthday and ended up loving them for myself. They are considered "Unisex" so their shouldn't be a problem right?? Lol. I think anyone interested in this product, should defently purchase ASAP!!!!	1
Bought this for camera and lens cleanup between shoots. Works great! Bought some as gifts for my photographer friends. They love them too.	0
This book is a great source of information for those studying to take the medical administrative assistant exam, as it's incredibly knowledgeable and full of insightful resources. The author really knows her stuff! There are so many informative questions to help study from, and one of the best study guides I've ever looked into. Well done!	1
One of the best games ever concieved...loved it...love it...will always love it! I recommend to the whole world! Best game in the 90's by far!	0
The headband is very well made..and so cute..I like that you can take the flower off and wear it by it self or change the flowers and bands and make your own color scheme ...	0
I like to vary the colors of sea salt i get so i receive a wide range of minerals that come from different regions. This was a a good buy.	1
I have had mine for a year now, and the second hand started to freeze up, then the chronographs did the same thing. It will cost me 150.00 to repair. Also be very aware of the fact that even though you get a warranty card with the watch the warranty will not be honored unless you have bought the watch from an official dealer. The &#34;warranties&#34; from various vendors on Amazon are null and void, you need to submit a receipt from a recognized dealer. I found this out the hard way, so if you have a defective watch, and a great many of them are according to my watch repair guy ( he won't sell Luminox anymore) you may be very disappointed. I do love the tritium, I can see enough to know what time it is. It is very light but was disappointed by the almost toy-like quality of the watch. If I had to do it all over again I would not buy this watch, and when my son's SEAL buddy told me that no SEAL he ever knew wore a Luminox, it's considered a joke of a watch by fellow operators. Buyer beware.	0
This storage unit was easy to put together and looks exactly like the picture. I purchased two of these units for my craft room, and I am happy with them, until now. I might buy more if needed.	1
Our previous grill cover cracked badly after a few years, so I was eager to try this new one.  It fits my grill perfectly.  Unfortunately I am unable to use the hook loops with the way my grill is designed, but I haven't had any issues so far with it becoming loose.<br /><br />The quality of the material is high, and is advertised as being crack-free.  The black color should do well to hide stains.  I expect this cover to last many years.	0
I got this for my husband as an anniversary present and he really adores it. Moreover it's a really affordable price compared to the mall!	1
Good quick reads as to ‘how to’ and ‘why’<br />…be Parisian<br />…French women don’t get fat<br />…Mediterranean women don’t get fat<br />…raise your children in the French fashion<br />have always been somewhat fun, a bit informative, as well as good conversation with your girl friends.<br /><br />However…<br />‘How to Be Parisian Wherever You Are…Love Style and Bad Habits’ is not any of the above.<br /><br />Among my French friends and acquaintances there is a diversity of style, thought, ethics and morals.<br /><br />As with any culture, there may be a definite trend in some cases but breaking it down…we are individuals.<br /><br />My personal opinion:<br />The Parisian way as depicted in this book is nothing I would wish to emulate, except for a few general points of interest that were no real revelation.<br /><br />I would not wish to follow in their footsteps, nor would I seek out friends who embraced this often trite, distant, pouting, smoking, on stage (despite the claims not to be) group.	0
Nothing makes a dinner table better looking (besides a good meal) than this napkin holder!  I love it.	0
At first I was a bit skeptical with such a different design than my<br />previous grill brushes, but all skepticism melted away just after its<br />first use!<br />Not only did this brush do the job cleaning the grill like normal, it<br />did a way better job catching all those spots missed in the past...I<br />guess there's something to say about this design after all :-)<br />Lastly, I wanted to mention that I received such helpful advice on how<br />to use this grill brush after my purchase. I thought the &#34;how to&#34; for<br />cleaning grills was pretty obvious, but I must say that I was proven<br />wrong! I definitely learned a few tips and tricks.<br />Thanks for such a great product! It's making my summer that much<br />sweeter..And please sent me more products to test	1
Warm and comfortable, although there is no arch support so walking long distances in them would result in painful feet. They slip on and off easily. Cover the ankles when shoveling snow or cleaning off the car of snow.	1
Have to make a quick detour to rave about this grill.<br /><br />I seem to remember they started on the television a couple decades ago.<br /><br />I think I've had a new one every five year and they're still working when I pass them on to someone else and buy new again.<br /><br />I love each new model though they are are nearly the same in quality which is very good.<br /><br />I cook on this more than anything else. It so easy to clean and nothing is greasy.<br /><br />It cooks everything from meat to grill cheesed sandwiches. I cook zucchini on it as well as other vegetables, like eggplant.<br /><br />Great grill.	1
When I decided to go back to school and get another major I decided to look for a new backpack. I love the color and it has a lot of compartments or pockets inside that you can put inside it with different things you need. Since I am going back to school I do have a lot of things I needed to pug around in it. I also like the straps because it is very sturdy and it does not feel like cutting into my shoulders. I like the way it hanging on my shoulders, it is very comfortable. To sum it up, I love it because it holds everything that I need and it is also surprisingly comfortable and really appears beautiful and durable. I highly recommend to all the students.	1
Upon receiving the product and opening it ,the product  seemed too have  separated,is this normal?<br />when I first used this  cream,seemed very oily to the face,my first thought  was another cream that's going<br />too break my face out.After 3 days of using it i noticed a  bit of a change,my skin is hydrated.has made my pores smaller,<br />and hoping too see some wrinkle magic!I would recommend this product,and look forward too seeing more results<br />Sincerely,<br />Christine Steging	0
This is bag is better than I expected! Who would think this stylish purse is really a dog carrier? My toy sized Yorkie fits very well in this and it's great being able to take her along with me when I'm running errands. I would recommend this to anyone with a toy Yorkie, poodle or chihuahua.	1
I love it, got it on sale and it goes well with white capri pants and casual baby-T shirts. They aren't supposed to look sophisticated and that's why I got them I have other watches to go for that scene, but getting an Invicta is me saying I'm fashionable casual, serious but lets it loose a some days in a week.	1
I have several watches from Seiko, Citizen, and Swatch. I'd have to say that this is a pretty decent watch (but not something I'd recommend to my friends). The timepiece doesn't look very extravagant. It's a good everyday watch.<br /><br />If you're on an event, I think you're better off wearing a different timepiece.	1
This mouthpiece worked fine, yet the cover would continuously slide off, often resulting in dust getting into the mouthpiece. I would recommend this to people, as long as they are willing to clean the mouthpiece thoroughly before and after use to prevent dust from accumulating.	1
Bought this for a university office where students hang out to study and they LOVED it!  Great quality and very comfortable.	0
Seven months into ownership the image quality has deteriorated and every time a commercial comes on or a scene changes a sharp crackling sound takes place.	0
It works just the way it said it would. It's nice to have, it made the computer smaller not having a disk drive. So when you need to put a disk in all you have to do is pug it in.	0
I have been doing Kakuro puzzles for years and though I am not an expert, I usually am able to complete the majority of the puzzles in a book.  These however are extremely difficult.	0
I've used this umbrella for years and bought one for my spouse.  Compact, but opens big enough for 2 people.	0
Great for the price. Very basic and if worst case scenario it walks off its not a huge finical loss. I put a different pad on it though because the one that comes with it is a bit like a sponge and I didn't want to come to the tree and sit on a wet sponge. I didn't actually test its porosity but it sure looks like a sponge and I didn't want to find out the hard way.	0
This is just the &#34;BEST&#34; stuff out there to settle down your rambunctious little kitties, especially if you have a few...they do not get sick or anything on this product, so you don't have to worry about that, and it seems to be safe around humans who have many other allergies also  :)	0
Great stroller, but the child in the back needs to be able to follow directions not to kick the back of the front seat.	0
Taste is good, just you get so little in a bar. Very crispy, four wafer thin bites to a bar. Good taste but very disappointed in the size for the price.	0
My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!	1
I have the complete collection of the original series in their untouched format thanks to an enterprising dad, but I thought that I should get the Blu-ray collection as well. Overall, the effects have improved and the scenes are much cleaner. On the other hand, there are the changes that happened which really annoyed me to oblivion.	1
The clicking worked for a few times and then the flimsy plastic thing that causes the click breaks and doesn't hold the lid right.  Leaks a great deal.	0
Purchased this bed to create more room in my son's bedroom. Perfect! Went together well. Real wood, sturdy and I love the finish. It does get dinged easily (vacuum-oops) the only thing is that once the bed is put together the ladder doesn't move to be cleaned under.	1
Great systems & easy to install. I got mine setup less than an hour. Instructions are helpfull & easy to understands	0
We have been very pleased with these drum replacements. High yield, great image quality, and low cost; it does not get much better than that!!!	1
Initially had a problem with my kinobo microphone. But a quick email sorted it out and the replacement works very well. Thank you!	1
After only a few days my son showed me where the wool in the foot bed was wearing away, not just initial shedding, but to bare fabric below. I have considered sending them back. I thought the sole was wool like the lining, but now I'm not sure. There was a very strong chemical odor from them when I opened the box, but they no longer smell.	1
This series has everything on it. A great story of scheming and vengeance coupled with historical facts. It has blood and gore which is rarely shown in any series out there today. There is also nudity, there is nothing else you can ask for!<br /><br />The best thing about the series is that they keep on improving their effects. In first season, you could clearly see the fake blood but now, I keep on thinking, how do they do it? It's just that good.<br /><br />There is no series close to what Spartacus has brought into the table. The closest is probably Game of Thrones but Spartacus was the first so you might say it just copied the way Spartacus was going.	1
I was very happy and impressed right from the start with the high quality feel and look of this knife! High quality metal feels good to the grip, a surprisingly ultra bright light for its size, nice fire starter that really works and shoots out good sized sparks. Although it is a bit on the small size but still effective. I tested it and it did start a fire for me. I don't really have much use for the window breaker and seatbelt cutter, yet. But if the occasion arises, it's great to know I'll be ready to help save a life. Altogether, I am very pleased with this knife. Especially for the price!! I think this knife is actually underpriced for its quality and all it has to offer. Just my opinion.	1
This camera has turned out to be a great purchase for me. I'm not a professional cyclist, but I love attaching this camera to my helmet and go out with it during my bicycle rides and just press attention to the little details you don't get to see while riding. I love the quality it records videos and its brightness can't be more excellent and I love the fact that I can record the video in 1080p.	1
This is a nice steamer to have around the house, but I wouldn't necessarily call it a travel steamer.	1
I'm not a bike mechanic, but I can get by on my own. Foolishly, I installed the kickstand with the supplied bolt, and I turned it too far and cracked the housing. It's just a hairline split, and I felt it give and new to stop, so the kickstand is still intact and still on my bike and works fine, but that really bummed me out. At least put a note in with the packaging warning people that it's possible to over tighten the bolt and split the cast aluminum housing.<br /><br />Other than this, this is a good product. Kind of pricy but better than no kickstand at all.	0
Best product I have ever used on mold  & mildew.. I encourage all too  try this great product. Great value.	0
Crocs are one of only two brands of shoes that I can be on my feet all day at work! Love cross unisex classic clog!	0
Purchased this from Electrociti and they had a pretty good selection of projectors. They dont have any reviews but seem very reliable.	1
What is the hype with this movie. I finally got around to watching it and it was amazingly boring. But to each their own I guess.	1
I gave this product a 5 star review because it is so simple and yet so useful. It took me seconds to install it to the headrest with my iPad safely secure inside. It does miracles with my kids: no more fighting and screaming from behind. The long cable and charger that you get with the iPad Cinema connect easily to the ipad. I have the product for a while and it is in excellent shape after many uses. Great purchase!	1
We thought this was a good piece to at end of yard by neighborhood lake. There are a few of these that have been spotted in that water. From afar it looks exactly like one of the real birds.	1
The set is very cute.  The colors are vibrant, and as my son loves Chuggington, it's perfect.  The only drawback is that the comforter is very thin.  It'll be perfect during the summer, but for the winter I end up putting another blanket underneath.	0
This carrier is very well made and twins love it. I recommend this product. I called the manufacturer because I couldn't figure it out at first and they were amazing. Kudos for helping a parent of multiples with no sleep. lol Thanks.	1
I had taped my old ones together and found these. I am looking forward to wearing them and staying dry.	0
All but 2 of the bags were significantly underweight. I felt like everytime I threw the bags, the wind was pushing them because they were too light!!! I got these as a gift and didn't have the heart to ask how I could return them. I'll keep them as a backup, but I immediately went out and bought a new set.	1
This was by far the best of the releases. Jennifer Lawrence's acting has surely developed over the years. I ts surprising how closely this could mirror real life, even in this country. Man/s inhumanity to man never ceases to amaze me. A great film all around.	1
We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.  I (ok, my daughter) spotted this Bakol Jel Strawberry dessert in the grocery store last week (about $3.50 a package) and was very happy to see this cleaner, non gmo version.  It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert. The ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, vegetable gum, citric acid, potassium citrate, natural flavor, beet powder. I apologize for taking a picture of it on an orange plate, it's hard to see the color (which is a pale pink).  The Jel had been completely devoured by the kids before I could correct my mistake!	0
I am a loyal shopper and this is the first purchase I've been disappointed by. Do not get this! No only is it not worth it, my necklace broke with 2 weeks. It looks cheap and is not worth the cost.	1
This is really an awesome product for all parents who have little children. This has helped my son in his teething problem and now we are all at peace! Its made such that its perfectly safe in case the necklace breaks. The package also comes with instructions on how to test it.<br />I am really happy with my purchase. You must try it too if your children just started teething or have problems.	1
We have had to replace 3 in 1 year .It is a hassle to have to mail them back and sometime they gave me so much attitude in the customer service division...I went with Belkin and I have had no more replacement problems because it works right and doesn't go out every 3 months.	1
I bought 2 of these nightstands and they look great with the headboard!  Very attractive and very well made!	0
It won't stick to the wall even when I put heavy duty stickys on it. The plastic that holds the two sections together is too stiff so it won't stay bent thus pulling it from the wall.	0
When watching this video, you will see why it was easier for people to fall in love with Britney back then because she had this bubbly, sweet, girly, and cheery personality with a preppy, soft, baby like voice. When she performs on stage, she smiles and friendly engages with the crowd. She mostly rambles about in this video on how she got started with dancing, the MMC, her hometown, and working on her first album and music videos. I do admit that hearing songs like Sometimes and From The Bottom Of My Broken Heart does take me back to middle school and how nice and innocent those days were. I actually like those songs better than Baby One More Time. As mushy and corny those songs can be, I did enjoyed the sweet sentiment of those songs. I think after she broke up with Justin, you could definitely see the changes in her personality and behavior. She started doing really stupid things, but I guess she kinda wise up from her mistakes now that she's older. I think this DVD is good for people who are just starting to like Britney and her music, and for people who are generally feeling nostalgic about their school days in the 90s and the bubblegum pop era.	0
I rather liked them. I wouldn't go as far as to say I would kill for them like I would for Pretzel Crisps, but I would hide them behind other products to come back and buy later, I don't but if I had to I would.<br /><br />I like that they are more sweet than other oreo cookies, but I wish they had more stuffing. I kind of wish that for all oreo cookies though.<br /><br />PLUS<br />-Great taste, sweet<br /><br />MINUS<br />-Hard to find. They are deleted (I work at Walmart part time so I know the company is not making them again unless like 2 million people write in requesting it) so if I fall in love with them I will never get them again<br />-Not enough stuffing<br />-Go stale faster than normal oreos, odd right?	0
I never thought I would ever pay as much as $20 for a travel mug. But I really got tired of making coffee in the morning and having it be lukewarm by the time I got to work. This mug is the perfect solution. Overall a well-made product that I hope to enjoy for a long time.	1
I tried a few hair growth products over the years and recently switched over to dasgro mainly because I found it gave me the best result with the least amount of issues. I have a sensitive stomach and most tablets and pills give me stomach aches but not this one. And I absolutely love what it does for my hair!	1
This Stalion case comes with 9 different case colors to choose from: black, blue, green, orange, pink, purple, red, yellow and magenda. I bought black one. I would not hesitate to recommend Stalion case for the maximum protection it gives.	1
Brings back those painful memories of basic training! At least now I jog in the park and log like I once could go faster!!<br />Nice quality product as expected, it has been in the was a few times and still looks new. I ordered a small and it fitted fine.	0
Takes a really long time to get going, then only dispenses fog for about 10 seconds.  I suppose it's not bad for the price but it's certainly not good.	0
My foot is so wide! When trying on shoes I would always have a hard time putting my foot in, but with these I had no problem. They are great! Get them!	0

It's hard for me to part with my hard earned money.  So when i see deals like this, I stock up on them.<br /><br />I have been supporting Bed Bug Patrol for years anyway.  It really help get rid of ant infestation we have every summer.  When we see them crawling we hunt down their colony and just keep spraying on it everyday. A few days after problem solved.  Its great for keeping bed from bugs plus it smell wonderful.<br /><br />I suggest you try these out yourself.	1
I gave the firefork to each of my sons as stocking stuffers for Christmas and kept one for myself.  They seem to be well built and will be handy for when we go camping.  Having 4 to the pack will make it easy for the members of the families to do weiners and marshmellows without having to wait turns.	0
I love that this grill has compartment/side tables where I can place whatever it is I'm grilling before actually grilling it. I use the one on the side for my condiments and marinade that I brush my steak with from time to time while grilling. . best feature for me though is the upper part great for heating pita wraps, schubligs, and everything that only needs quick heating or smoking.	1
These insoles were prescribed by my foot specialist, to be inserted in my New Balance walking shoes. I was recuperating from an avuncular fracture of the ankle and suffering from tendinitis as a result, these insoles have made a difference in support and comfort.	0
Yummy hot cocoa. My kids are enjoying the heck out of this. Will most likely order more. Rich and creamy....i think it wss a good deal. And it came on time and that meant a lot to me.	0
think of a game that is better than oblivion and almost as good as morrowind. the story failed at the final battle. it was too easy. i beat the boss in 3 minutes. yet the story is interesting. the legendary version offer new weapons and armor. the ability to go beyond level 30 skills. i am at level 210 and need more to get all skills maxed out. i havent played the game in quite a while so i dont remember details perfectly. there are 2 new locations that offer thier own missions and trophies. if you love elder scrolls you should play this. if you have the original version of this game, through it out or trade it to a sucker and get this version. i did.	0
Very interesting material but not a book that really grabbed me. Perhaps its because its not the usual kind of book I read.	1
BEAUTIFUL! It's perfect... I was afraid to purchase it because I had a bad experience with a veil I bought online. It wasn't as described. This was exactly what I ordered.	0
Works very well. And better than cable tv. This is superior to rabbit ears antenna. I used to think the cable would provide a more clear signal. I was wrong.	0
I Like this rug.Its thinner than most but I needed that so the chairs would pull out easy.It looks very Dramatic because the colors are vivid and it vacuums up nicely.	0
The cable was as advertised and very cost-effective.  It was ordered to meet my daughter's need and it does exactly what I needed it to do.	0
My only complaint was that when using the seat bolt the top bar is to long and puts my laptop to close to the steering wheel. To get it away from the steering wheel you have to lean it toward the passenger door and that prevents anyone from sitting in the passenger seat.	0
[[VIDEOID:511e63a55ccc9fe99d2229586c6eb19e]] Three things attracted me to this model.<br /><br />1. Long battery life. When I need a screwdriver, I don't always have time to charge it. This battery remains charged for quite a few months, so it's ready when you need it.<br /><br />2. I love the size. It seems to me that more often than not, I don't have room to use my full sized power driver. This one is just right. It's big enough to tackle tough screws, but small enough to fit into small places.<br /><br />3. The retractible magnetic screw holder is so handy, you'll wonder why anyone would want a driver without it. Sometimes there isn't enough room for you to hold the screw in place, or you need to use your other hand to hold something else. As long as the screw is magnetic, you just pill out the screw holder and it stays in place. Once the screw starts moving in, the holder slides back into place.	0
The bean bags arrived on time so that was good. Everything else was downhill! The bags had a terrible smell to them when they arrived. Not sure if that if that is amazon's fault or the company that made them, but I wasn't happy.	1
This is one of the wonderful watch from Tommy Hilfiger.Its look great and shipping was quick.I would highly recommend this watch.	1
Excellent book for me- I'm a bit rusty on research techniques in music education, but this very readable text is bringing me up to speed.  Worth reading multiple times- would be great for a graduate course in music education research techniques.	0
I actually waited to get this system, but once I found out they were selling it without that creepy eye unit, I jumped on it. Granted I see what they possibly meant by it being "essential”, but it was only essential to what THEY wanted, not US. They listened. Happy camper!	1
It feels pretty sturdy for the price. There is no problem to mount it outdoor in rainy or sunny days. Configuration is easy. Image The image quality is good enough so that I am able to watch my property around way from my house. IR LEDs are always on in the dark. In summary it is very good for the price.	1
This antenna booster really not work at all, even I tried in my house or my daughter's house, just not work and receive fewer channel also the quality is bad, I am not sure I got lemon but I am so disappointed.  *** We do follow the instruction and we are not close to the tower and still not work!	1
Completely disappointed with this product. Returned the first one, because (I thought) it was damaged. When the replacement came in, it was just as bad. Apparently what I thought was damage, was just the poor quality of this product. Would not recommend anyone to purchase this.	1
Good price and worth ordering here. I haven't done comparison shopping on prices, but it's great getting items I need right to my door.	0
These Monticello greenhouses are way over priced compared to what other companies offer.  It is amazing how many lower priced, high quality greenhouses you have in the market.  Amazon sells a lot of value oriented products. These greenhouses are no value.	1
Well presented box, good quality finish, good value for money received very promptly very happy with the overall feel of this watch	1
This battery is the perfect replacement for my orginial Olympus battery...great to have on hand when your orginial battery needs to be recharged.	0
Perfect for my wooden floor! The pic color kind of deceiving though. It's more brownish than bluish. It's a great buy!	0
I had two black bar stools and I was looking for the perfect bar height table to go with them for my new apartment. I had limited space to work with and I just wanted something simple and practical.	1
I can't think of using my go pro without this kit. It has EVERYTHING I ever needed. The headband is the best accesory of all.  I use it every time when disassembling anything really complicated in the auto shop I work. We'll worth the money	1
My review for this ceramic blade is that ; this ceramic blade cuts fruits and vegetables into beautiful thin slices and I do like that it is light and easy to wash. I have prepared apple cinnamon chips the moment I got mandoline slicer. The only thing I can suggest is "just be careful" fortunately I already had metal gloves in my kitchen so, metal gloves and this tool Is just a great match, and slicing fruits and vegetables with this mandoline slicer is just like a walk in the park.	1
i have gotten these n a promotion and the feeling i have when i take them is great it cleans me right out and the energy is amazing i highly recommend buying these if you have constipation problems	1
Bought it for my friend who just get his new HP 19'' Laptop. It's just fit for the laptop. The texture is thinner than we thought before.	0
i really like this ink, it fills in very well and the colors and nice vibrant. good quality stuff. i approve.	0
Very nice looking headphones that sound as good as it looks. It makes downloading and storing FLAC files totally worth it.	1
When I was a little child I used to watch the Donald cartoons every Sunday afternoon. We lived in these years in Poland so it was so difficult to found Donald tales. After we moved to USA and my brother and perhaps also myself watch this cartoon regularly. My favourite character was Dagobert. He was so funny.<br /><br />Some months ago I started to watching Donald films again. It is a great fun! I still enjoy these stories. My childrens (2 boys and 1 girl) also like it.<br /><br />Donald duck for ever!	1
This is a very fun cover for my little boy. I do think the material is a bit too thin. If he wears it at night he soaks through it.	0
I bought this to join another couples leaving party, they're heading to Canada. Everyone loved it! I've lent it to two friends already for parties, it fits everyone and fits in for anything! It's such good material and so comfy I find myself wearing it most evenings as well. Overall delighted with my purchase and feel I get so much more out of it then I envisioned...	1
This toy is very small, the pack contains all three but it's not worth the price for all three plush toys. It's looks very cheap also....	1
I have been an avid Amazon shopper for many years, but this is the first product I am writing a review for, because of how impressed I am with the shoe.  First off, I have had fairly extensive knee problems for many years, and have had eleven surgeries, gone through hours of physical therapy for these and for ITB syndrome, etc.  To some degree the fact that I continue to be a runner is maybe a bit hard-nosed and stubborn, but I love it too much to think about giving it up.  I've tried various shoes (about 12 different pairs of runners in the past three years alone), various knee braces/apparatus/sleeves, and varied running environments from rubber track to road to trail.  I've always been an Asics guy, but have also tried New Balance, Adidas, Brooks and Nike.  I've always tried to find a shoe with extra cushion, thinking it would absorb impact rather than distributing it to my knees.  This is my first Mizuno product, which I decided to try after my Uncle recommended the brand to me based on his love for the Wave Riders; I was a bit leary, having tried multiple shoe brands, and decided on these Wave Creations based on his, and other reviews.  This shoe does NOT offer my heel that super cushiony feel yet gives me the support I need to run pain-free, even days after my runs.  I've begun to think that, like my sleep number bed, which I inflate to a more firm setting when I have back pain, that perhaps my thinking with shoes has been wrong all along, and that the more firm shoe is actually offering me more support in a similar manner.  If you're like me, and have been continually frustrated with knee/ITB difficulties, consider this shoe; it may not be for everyone but it's done wonders for me.  I have a high arch and am an under pronator; I am 5'11" and at the time of this writing weigh an even 200 lbs.  I recommend purchasing this shoe in a 1/2 size larger than your regular sneaks, but then I recommend the same for any running shoe as it had been advised to me by a professional several years ago and I've always stuck with that.	0
They look and feel very cool. Many compliments so far. Fast shipping too. I highly recommend them. They are big though... which I love.	0
Looked high and low for an affordable and comfortable boot as I work in education and on my feet all day. Found these and couldn't be happier. They arrived 3 days earlier than expected as well.	1
I heard a lot of buzz about this game before it came out but was hesitant since; well EA has not had the best track record as of late. But I was wrong; this game is bascially all the fun things from every FPS of the last 20 years rolled into one. The guy who made it is responsible for the first Call of Duty Modern Warfare (and not the later ones that were just churned out to make a quick buck). I am honestly playing this as much as I did COD MW back in the day. I love it on the XBOX One as I prefer multiplayer games like this on the console but should be just as good on the other platforms.	0
This device is a worthless piece of junk. A total waste of money.<br />1. It can not be connected to household outlet. It only works when connects to car battery.<br />2. The motor burned out with smoke and burning smell coming out of the thing during the third use.	1
I like the color of these chairs. The quality is great, especially for the price. I needed three so I had to order them twice but for the price I'm very happy with them. They were easy to assemble too.	0
I bought two bottles of shampoo, another one sealed,  this one is not sealed. this one tastes like “FURminator deShedding Ultra Premium Shampoo"	1
These are the best potty pads I've ever purchased. Am now using them as a back-up plan for a small, aging dog and wish I'd known about them when she was a puppy. They are extremely absorbent and leave NO odor. I use them to soak up her infrequent messes as they work way better than paper towels.	0
I'm 150lbs, almost 6ft, athletic build, lots of cardio and swiming. This s*** fits snug in all the right places, but breathes in others. Not too short in length either. Love the wide v-neck. The material is SUPER soft too. Almost like my Banana Republic Cashmere's. Highly recommend for my body build.	0
So far so good the pictures I have taken have a good pixel quality not bad for the price. I have used it several times and it does the job pretty well the zoom is very helpful.	1
Great book .I enjoyed this book.Brilliance is an exciting &#34;futuristic&#34; story that could easily have taken place today. A fun read, can't wait to start the 2nd novel.	1
I love it. I can't believe how integrated the whole game is. It's like it's own little world. It has literally everything in it. It must have taken a long long time to create write and make. I can't even imagine. But I love the game and realistic aspect of it. Almost feels like your really there. I can't wait until the next one comes out.	1
We love Jane Eyre and now the youngest reader can enjoy this classic. These are the best board books available and will become classics of their own.  i'm hoping the needle felted characters will become available for purchase!	0
okay this speaker is pretty great but it took me a while to figure out the battery charging whatever just dont use the battery switch under the rubber flap on the side only use the power button on the top leave the switch in the on position during charging  its loud  very loud for a bluetooth and ive used it in the shower (not directly in water but near sprinkles and humidity)  ive dropped it at the farm in dirt  its great really worth the purchase for me  oh yea and full blast it can go on for five hours no joke  i bring it to work and basically everywhere  need a car charger for it thoooughhghghghghg	0
WOW. The Smith&Stanley Car Escape Tool really does beat all the budget tools out there! This really is a quality product. Yes, it does cost a little bit more, but for a tool that could possibly save your life, I certainly don't have any issues in spending on this tool which works out to be less money than the price of a tank of fuel. And this tool could actually end up saving my life, and whomever I buy it for. This is simply a tool that does its job. It slices the belt faultlessly, and smashes glass effortlessly. I tested it. I figured that a tool like this can't be left to see if it works or not until I'm in an emergency situation. I noticed that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews of the other tools are given by buyers who haven't tested the tool. Whilst the negative 1 star poor reviews are given by buyers who've actually tried it out and didn't find what they expected! Yikes! That was a real worry to me. What I like about this tool is that it has the right materials to do the job – an extremely sharp Titanium blade and a really tough head made of hardened Carbon steel. I looked into this more and found that to break toughened glass you'll need at least something like hardened carbon steel. However, budget tools are mostly made from softer steel. I've tested these and they're pretty useless! Just have a look on YouTube and you'll see people struggling with them. This tool, unlike others, is also approved, tested, and certified by TUV – I haven't seen this in many tools like this. The certifications and approvals it comes with are certainly worth it in terms of peace of mind knowing that what you've bought has already been approved that it can do its job. I don't know about you, but for me that's a simple check. In summary, I'm very glad I got this tool, and I'm happy to recommend it. However, I would say that before buying yours, check that it can do the job. For a life-saving tool, I really don't think cheap is necessarily thebest option??? Hope that helps and informs.	1
Just received a product with one of the edge bent. Box was clean but product was damaged...return it right away.It totally waste my time.	1
I ordered this after seeing its first look in screenshot and i loves this one alot. I have several HDMI products and i am in need of this kind of product and right now i am enjoying this on my PS4 .<br />Its quality is perfect .	1
they were the usual perfect fit as ordered - I have never been disappointed in the quality or the fit in any levi product	0
It installed relatively easy, functions great and is easy to clean. I've been using it for more than one month and it's not been a problem. The hose also works well. For the price, you cannot miss it.	1
When the purple nail polish is wet, it looks really cool, but when it dries it turns almost black and it's not very glittery. i like the plain glitter and i think it would look good with a white basecoat.	1
For a 2 cell this thing rocks. So bright. Brighter than my 3 cell. Bought one for my son also. He loves it!!	0
This drive is fast and looks sharp. It's a bit bulky so have some space ready for it. Installation was a snap and my first project burned with this was trouble free. I purchased them by the way. The only downside was the quality of the eject button.	1
Worthless book.  Poorly written.  Full of generalities.  VERY short on specifics.  Spend your money on something else and you'll be well ahead of the game.	0
I got these to cut & trim electronic part leads on a couple of IC circuit board projects.<br /><br />I've found that it works well with this:<br />http://www.amazon.vote/dp/B00FZPDG1K/<br /><br />They work really well and cut hundreds of leads effortlessly.<br /><br />The cutting edges are well machined and give you the control you need for working in tight spaces.	1
After a snafu in shipping, I reordered this PC board to make an adjustable Power Feed for my boat to drive a device that uses Two D cell batteries to aerate my live well.  Works great and just plugs into the lighter socket on the dash.  I take it and the bubbler off for transport of the bucket and let the batteries take over when I'm not near a 12vdc lighter socket.  Works great.	0
We've loved playing this over the years with our kids. They still love these games and on the occasional weekend we spend a fair amount of time playing these games with them. Nice clean fun with no violence of grotesque story lines. Very kid friendly!	1
I think Libbey Vibe jars, which come in every size, are a great deal. i have this size and plan on going back for the spice jars, 12 oz and 27 oz at least. They are machine washable, have a good enough seal, and look smashing. The price is very reasonable. It's tempting to pick them up by the lid, but not a good idea with heavier ones. These will definitely be prominent  in my new pantry.	0
The first problem with this product is the sound quality, which is exceptionally poor.  My cell phone has better external speakers than this crappy television.  Second, it is nearly impossible to see from any angle other than dead center.  Finally, and worst of all, we got a flashing red light after just seven months of use that said &#34;I am dead&#34;.  Completely dead in just seven months.  I would absolutely not purchase this awful bit cheap junk again.	0
Great thread for quilting. This stuff is strong but slender, and the spool seems to last forever. Happy to find this at Amazon.	0
I bought this mask for my prom party, The mask is incredibly awesome as the design is quite unique as well as the shiny stones on it which makes it perfect as party mask. No doubt the quality is nice but also it doesn't gets weary and the mask is well designed to last long. The other designs are quite nice too but I like this one the most cause it made my prom day adorably awesome. I'll surely recommend to buy masks from them.	1
Very well made cable but I had to return it for a longer one of the same as this was a little to short, but very well made .	0
I bought the black pumps and they worked perfect with my slacks for work. Fit true to size. And pictures were accurate to the onsite image	1
I was really excited about ordering the Ford Mustang Valve Caps.<br />I put them on my Mustang & I must say, They look awesome!!!	0
A nice package of large cards for a very reasonable price. We seem to be sending more and more sympathy cards these days, and this fills that (not so cheerful) bill perfectly.	0
The fact that I could order this device, program it for 5 minutes, stick it upside down in the sheepfold in my yard and now every time the weather sucks or my son hears a noise and tells me to go check on the lambs all I have to do is roll my eyes, pull out my iPhone and show him a LIVE VIDEO FEED of his lambs happily chewing on their grass . I can even hear them crunching on them! THAT IS AWESOME!<br /> I am going back to Amazon and ordering additional cameras.<br />NOTE though, every time you reboot your modem, you get new IP address.<br />and unless you find a way to make the address in your router to camera static. you need to check attached devices addresses, to access cam again . ALL easy.. once you learn it.<br />the wifi is just too handy.. anywhere there is power,within range of the router.. you got a remote view.	1
Best toaster oven I have ever owned. Really does toast things more evenly. We roast and bake in it occasionally too.	0
Has everything I wanted but the paper is extremely thin. Needed to mount it on posterboard just to get it to stay flat.	1
I found this to be far more fascinating than David Cordingly's books about Caribbean pirates specifically because Joseph Gibbs' book contains so many first hand accounts. The pirates and pirate hunters provide their story in their own words; with Gibbs' narrative as the binder holding the parts to the central theme.<br /><br />Where Cordingly so often explains his interpretations of history, and discusses how his interpretation differs from others; &#34;On the Account&#34; presents first-hand evidence, and allows you to make your own interpretation.	0
Second set! My original was installed on my old pop-up camper that I sold. Important to note, while these LOOK the same, they apparently are NOT. One is labeled "CA" and the other "3". The manufacturer states that they should be placed in a particular order. I didn't notice that before on my original camper. But they worked fine. This time around, I followed the directions and place them accordingly.	0
This is an excellent product. Very soft and great quality. The baby is able to hold it herself without any problem. Getting it back into her mouth by herself is easier now. Great purchase!	1
I returned item. It was not for xbox 360. It is for regular xbox. The advertisement is unclear that this cord isn't for the 360 so I was disappointed that it was not for the 360.	0
I use this product to steam clean our curtains, my daughter's stuffed animals/throw pillows when I can't or don't have time to wash them. Easy to use. It's easy enough to use but it tends to get a little heavy when doing larger jobs but that would be the case with any appliance.	1
I had high hopes for a thickening shampoo instead it left me with less hair then before and I feel like it accelerated my hair loss further. I will not continue using it and will return the remainder for a refund	1
I put these on my Harley, and immediately experienced a gain of 10HP at the rear wheel, and 15-foot lbs of toque.<br />They made my bike faster and louder.<br />Thanks to these battery tenders terminals, I have to take my wife along with me wherever I go on the bike. Otherwise, beautiful women throw themselves at me wherever I go, which my wife does not appreciate.<br />They also worked just fine with my existing battery tenders, but who cares about that?	0
Good instruction on all the videos, with clear sgements outlined on the menus.  For instance on stress relief, sections for digestion, back, etc.  Like that there was some real easy things on inflexible and also on other videos (just resting lying down) to start off with.  All of them are also visually appealing with the beach, ocean and widescreen presentation.	1
Good purchase!!! Pretty easy to set up and operate. Works great and performs well. I'm no wizard with home audio but I'm very happy with this equipment	0
I am not much of a coffee drinker, but for an art project I had to research and choose coffee products that have a design that catches people's attention. Well this one sure did!<br /><br />After grinding, prepping and brewing led to a great cup of coffee. There is a lot of experimenting and all taste great. I tried it black, with cream, as a frappe and mixing with other ingredients. The taste is wonderful in all cases! If you are a beginner coffee drinker, I suggest this one! Once I am done, I will try the other flavors Kicking Horse Coffee has to offer.<br /><br />Side note:<br />Organic coffee has better taste, texture and flavor than non-organic coffee. No harsh chemicals used in the whole process (unlike other companies).	0
Seems to perform just ok, it's a battery. Came packed well, easy to put in my Note 3, doesn't look used..it's a smidge more than batteries that say their OEM, but besides the label, there doesn't seem to be a difference.	1
My poster was a little wrinkled, but ill live with it. Not that big of a deal. But wish they packaged it better.	0
I've been using this for a couple of months now and i like how my games are all stacked up inside the case.	1
Great purchase.  Easy to exchange the bands in just a few minutes. Very pleased with the fit and accuracy of the watch.	0
Strangers in remote places always look at this device with awe whenever I bring it with me since they never really expect a speaker in the middle of nowhere. I have to say that the sound could be better, but what can you expect?	1
These are completely addicting. We eat a lot of sushi and this seaweed works perfectly. Sheets are organic, roasted perfectly, and they are the perfect thickness. Flavor wise, excellent. It was packaged well and tasted fresh. Would definitely recommend this product for any sushi lover out there!	1
This is the FIRST thing I have purchased from here that I did not feel deserved 5 stars. The liner was several inches shorted than stated. The rod had previously been opened and the pieces weren't well situated. Disappointing!	1
We have a 7 season old, semi-aniline sofa which the salesman said it didn't need anything because of the aniline but a few decades later it began to get dry and difficult especially on the hands. Well, after implementing Set Sweetie the leather not only looks excellent, because most of the cat the begining represents are gone, but it seems awesome and smooth again! Thanks to make such an awesome product! This things works!!!	1
Its an nice case with transparent body totally got fit on my new iphone 6, loving it thanks for the product	1
I'm not a techy person so I'm not going to go over the specs of this product. I'm an Apple lover and I love vlogging so I got this last Christmas season as a gift to myself. I have to say though that this is perfect for when editing my videos. It's compact and lightweight. Needless to say, I love my Macbook.	1
This fits a 2000 caviler perfectly. Is very simple to install and heavy steel. I expect it to last much longer than previous brackets that I have had professionally installed and I paid considerable less for this one. The hanger slides into place, and there is one excessively long bolt to close the clamp, but the bolt does not got in the way of anything, it just makes it easier to close the very strong clamp.	0
I put off buying this piece until one of my last purchases from this line. The promo pic that EVERYONE uses just doesn't look so great. In hand, this thing is beautiful. His face actually has a great expression; he's biting the edge of his lower lip, and looking to the side. You can't really see any of that in the picture. It's very Riddler/mischievous looking. It's also a lot taller and skinnier looking in person. Really nice sculpt. Good paint. The cane is really nice, and to be honest, I display the statue back facing forward. Makes for a great display with the rest of the line. Overall a must have if you collect this line.	0
LOVE this supplement. Definitely noticed an improvement in my physical wellness. I have a lot of joint pain and overall body pain, and this has definitely been helping. Also kind of a great appetite suppressant, since there is so much good stuff in there.	0
Awesome item！！！Bicycle phone mount and Goporo handlebar mount 2 in 1.I have snowmobiles, bikes, motorcycles, etc. and have bought multiple types of GULAKI mounts across them to hold my iPhone, Go-pro camera, and other things. They have all worked.Recently,when I except to find one Mount which can both mount my iPhone 6 and Go-pro. This item come to my mind.With the clip,it can hold the iPhone 6 plus easily and securely. This mount will also attach to the bottom of most cameras including GoPros and Contours and smartphones, and likely most traditional cameras as well. Great to put right on your handlebars and capture the action real time. GULAKI has added a lot of value and don't cost much at all.I'm extremely happy with this purchase.Great price on Amazon	1
I love this case! I've got a pair of BeoPlay H6 Headphones, and this case is a PERFECT fit! Not just size-wise, but the headphones look great in the case. The the premium feel of the microsuede and memory foam lining just adds to the whole experience. I also love the removable zippered pouch--super useful for adaptors, cables, etc. Exterior-wise the case is really solid and durable, but that doesn't stop it from looking really sleek with the carbon-fiber looking finish. Add the handle, loop, and cool laser engraved carabiner, and this case is just really slick and well thought out.	1
It was very easy to assemble. It is made of quality materials and sturdy. It works well. Having the handle bar is great because it's easier to read the meter. It doesn't take up much space. I'm glad I bought it.	1
As a parent and now grandparent of game-lovers, I am always on the lookout for games that adults can play along with little ones.  Unlike many of games geared toward children, Ravensburger's "Race To The Roof" does not cause adults to cringe when a child presents it for playing.<br /><br />"Race To The Roof" can be played with and enjoyed by children who are younger than the suggested age range of 5 years or older.  The objects to be located are ones with which most children will be familiar; if not, the unfamiliar items provide a learning opportunity.  Counting the spaces one must move reinforces the ability to sequence numbers.  Having to move backward gives children the opportunity to "overcome" a set-back and to learn that luck sometimes plays a part in who wins and who loses.<br /><br />The quality of Ravensburger's "Race To The Roof" is a bit less than I would have expected.  Instead of a game board that is one-piece and hinged in the center, "Race To The Roof" has a two piece game-board.  Unlike older board-game playing surfaces, this item is not constructed of a very heavy cardboard. While it might be somewhat difficult for very young children to damage, determined three-year olds would have no trouble bending the pieces.  The wooden game pieces are unevenly painted; our yellow picec shows the wood-grain around its center point.  Illustrations are simplistic; this seems to be a trend with illustrations in books as well as in games.<br /><br />Ravensburger produces games that are both fun to play and provide learning opportunities for children.  I would like to see Ravensburger use better quality components so that their games last through several children and can be kept by parents to be played with future generations.	0
I bought these as a birthday gift for my father. Let me just say that he is hard of hearing and drives my mom crazy with the volume of his computer. I think these may have actually saved their marriage. He loves them because he can turn them up as loud as he wants and she loves them because NO sound leaks through to the rest of the house. The only thing he said he doesn't like is the length of the cord (like many other reviews) but this is a VERY small price to pay for the quality. He has said that the sound is crisp and clear (mind you this is coming from a partially deaf man) and he couldn't be happier.	0
I really like this grip, it fits several pans that I own and allows handling without a mitt. I would buy again.	0
I am a heavy user of dried chives and this was an excellent value. The bag is re-sealable and stores well.	0
I require quality and freshness when cooking and baking. This product has both, I keep a bag in the refrigerator on hand at all times to use with my bread maker. I bought it originally to use with bread mixes that had gone out of date to replace the yeast pack inside. I can say I got a better bread with this yeast then with the yeast provided. If you like quality and just plain good yeast-- this is the product for you.	0
The TV portion of this works great. The picture quality is excellent.<br />The SMART TV portion doesn't work so well. After a while Netflicks quit working. I tried upgrading my wifi modem and that didn't help. I went back to using my Roku for the smart part of my entertainment.	0
Loved this speaker so much that I lost it in some deep water kayaking and ordered a second one the same day! Wish I could have found the one that sunk.. Next one will be attached haha	0
I got to use one of these for the first time last week. It is a heck of a little board. I use a long board and didn't think much of this, but it was pure funny fun. It's a sturdy make which allowed for great maneuverability. I felt I had complete control of this board. Good stuff. Love the name: Wham-O!	1
Great looking watch but you better have a really big wrist to wear it. The watch is heavy and the band is stiff.	1
I like this watch. I found the blue dial is slightly darker than how it looks in the picture, but no problems reading the time. The hands illuminate after being exposed to direct light, although it doesnt last long. The strap itself is short, should be another inch longer. Good Fossil quality.	0
I've always wanted a pork pie hat since I saw Benny and joon.<br />This hat is very unique so wearing it makes me feel like I'm different in a cool way. I was worried about the hat size because it wasn't a specific hat size i. e. 7 and 3/8. But it fits me perfectly. I ordered a large. I collect hats and I'm glad to add this hat to my collection.	0
I am using this protector on a guest room bed.  This is not a luxurious cover; the top is polyester with vinyl backing under the fabric & vinyl side walls.  It is challenging to get this on your mattress so I use a washable mattress pad over it & just consider this cover part of the mattress.  It is waterproof so if you have bed-wetters, etc. , this will provide protection.<br /><br />It is machine washable but I would hang it to dry so you don't damage the vinyl. I think it would be a good idea to use a High Efficiency (h*e) washing machine to prevent damage to the vinyl.  The agitator on a traditional machine might be hard on it.<br /><br />I have never had a bed bug infestation (thank goodness!!) so can't speak to that but this cover is similar to the type you see on hotel beds everywhere these days.  For bed bug protection, if you have a box spring under your mattress, you really should encase that also.  The zipper is sturdy & has the extra protection of a Velcro closure flap so that bugs can't get in at the vulnerable end of the zipper.	0
This folio stand is great. The keyboard battery seems to last for what seems like forever before I have to charge it. Syncs with my iPad really quick.	0
My husband bought five for my daughter. They look so cute in actual and my baby looks very pretty when wearing them. Wonderful stuff for baby girls!	1
I love my di Oro Living Silicone Spatula Set!  They work well with anything that I'm mixing or cooking. These are so much better than the traditional spatulas because they won't break and they're one piece. I like that there are three different sizes in the set.  I also love the red color!  I would highly recommend these to anyone who's on the fence about purchasing the set.	1
What a beautiful mouse. Has everything you will ever need for the average user. This isn't an MMO mouse or anything so don't expect myriad buttons and access to those kinds of features. It does have an extensive macro system though, and the features on the new firmware are pretty decent for this price range. At any rate mouse enthusiasts usually know what their mouses are for.  The side pads as many have said have a sweet feeling sandpaper-like compound... BUT this doesn't last as long as one would like for the thumb position IF you use the mouse a lot. MANY mice today use that decrepit shiny and sticky plastic for where your thumb/pinky finger goes...  The feeling after this compound wears down is akin to a slightly stickier plastic. The plastic itself is hard enough so the feeling is never too annoying; I must stress how important this is, because a soft and sticky plastic for my thumb and other fingers will have me wanting to throw the mouse away nearly immediately. I wish the normal sandpaper feel had been able to keep itself for at least 6 months. But this is still much better than my last mouse in feel and touch. I love the overall design of it.  I'm just grateful they didn't go with that nasty, shiny stuff CM used on my Havoc.   Anyway, I updated firmware and installed software in 2 minutes. While not quite the extensive system of options that CM has, this mouse for the time being has topped my old Havoc which had the aforementioned sticky plastic problem requiring tape. Otherwise I think CM's software is better and allows a lot more functionality with LEDs and a couple other things. What is there is pretty decent and you can tune each axis on the pad and have three different slots for DPI, easily reachable below the scroll wheel. A single, small and red LED light is for the first slot and this goes to three lights. They are pretty low key and not too bright. I shut off the Corsair logo as it was too bright and annoying for my tastes.  I am not sure what thenative specs are on the DPI sensor but I use about 900-1200 on my desktop and it feels about perfect. I certainly don't need much higher. My PC gaming is mostly done with a controller, but scrolling and clicking buttons works great for the games that need it.   As with every mouse make sure it fits your hand. I feel I can put my palm into if I want or just basically finger touch it and the control and ease with how this mouse glides makes mousing fun again (I have been using some dimestore version for the past 10 days). They have a nice supplement of weights if you choose to lower what they have at the factory. I don't mind it right out of the box. Others will want to take a weight or two out.  The roller is also topnotch here and has a metal and rubber design. Still working great after a year of solid work. The materials have held fairly well over this time and I am completely satisfied with the mouse. All in all a homerun for the M45.	0
I bought this because I got reading all the fantastic 5 star reviews. This stuff is so terrible I couldn't take more than a few bites and threw the rest in the garbage. Now I'm stuck with 5 more soups left that I'll just donate to the homeless.	1
Great Product and delivery. Great color match and blends very well with own hair color. I will recommend this product if you want to change your look with thinning hair	0
Very disappointed with these bags. I could tell when I opened the box that they looked cheap; more like the ones you see in big box stores. Sure enough, a few tosses in, one of the bag broke. After we decided to play with 3 bags per color, another bag broke! Unfortunately for us, it was the same color! That left 2 bags left of one color and 4 of another. We decided to just quit playing altogether.	1
They are light so it hardly feels like your wearing anything. They're definitely a go to type of glasses. The case that came with the sunglasses isn't anything wonderful but it's a case and it will protect the sunglasses, so I don't really care. I'm very happy with my purchase.	1
This is the kind of light that you want to bring with you if you want to illuminate your surroundings without feeling like you're carrying a lamp where you trapped the sun.	1
Let's be honest... this thing is really chintzy. It's much bigger than I expected (I was expecting something the size of a book, but it's really the size of a poster), but the fabric is really thin and flimsy, and the printing on it is atrocious- it looks like someone tried to stencil on the Hufflepuff crest but the paint bled under the stencil. It's pretty ugly, to be honest. If I had known how poor the quality was, I would have never have gotten it.<br /><br />However, my 9 year old is a loyal Hufflepuff (she got sorted into that house and has been obsessed ever since) and ANYTHING having to do with Hufflepuff makes her happy, so the banner was a welcome addition to her room. Just not front and center.	0
I've got this cool Little charger as a gift. It has a USB cable and a bag delivered with it.<br />It charges my old Samsung S3 and my new iPhone 6. For the iPhone I'm using my Apple cable. I love taking Pictures and now I have<br />enough power on the go... Love it.	1
Exactly what I was looking for and bigger than expected! It holds SO MUCH. It is a strong backpack. Love the design, so classical. Fast shipping also!! Thank you.	1
Got this for my golf shoes, like others.<br /><br />Pros:<br />  - low price<br />  - great construction<br />  - women's shoes fit with both soles facing down, so grass and sand eventually dries off and falls to the bottom of the bag if you keep it flat (probably will fit that way for men's shoes, too)<br />  - sturdy fabric makes it stiff enough for the sides to stay up and placement of the zipper allows it to function like a fabric box, and can be flattened when necessary, like when I put it in the back basket of the cart<br />  - mesh on sides allows shoes to air out but keeps grass clippings in the bag (keeps the car clean).<br /><br />Cons:<br />  - could make a smaller version for women's shoes	0
Not the best I've tried but still good. The texture is decent and the flavor is pretty strong. Using this for things like ice cream sprinkle or for adding it to your morning protein shake is quite recommendable.	1
My 7 year old twins have a ball with this thing nearly everyday! We live in a pretty safe cul-de-sac so they're forever taking turns zipping up and down the road with it. Right out of the box it seemed sturdy and well-suited for us. My kids are average weight for their age so there's not much problem with lagging or anything. We also make sure to keep it charged up and the tires seem like they'll last quite a while although I'm already prepared to buy new ones if need be. If only it ran a little longer each use, it would be perfect!	1
Good quality and just fits.  Keeps things from tipping.  Now I know this is a special item but I knocked off one star because they're a little pricey I thought.  Perfect execution though.	0
this musical has great music but the movie itself is kind of boring. Probably better as a CD to listen to around the house rather than watch on TV. just my personal opinion.	1
I'm so glad Nintendo finally released a licensed clear 3DS cover! This case is amazing. It's on the softer side so it's flexible and easy to put on (and it stays on!). It is completely transparent so if you have a decal or something directly on your 3DS, you can see it clearly. I personally bought this to protect the autographs I've collected on the front of my 3DS. I would definitely recommend this case!	0
The lights looked nice but they did not work. I returned them. They drained the battery after 30 seconds of being turned on.	0
Price was a shocker at first until the &#34;micro dimming ultimate&#34; feature sold me on it. Hope my kidney is enjoying its new house.	0
Really helps with curbing food cravings. No negative side effects so far. Works as advertised. What can I say, great product!	1
I love Blue Monkey coconut water. For my money, its the best on the market. That said, the stock they're selling here is very poor.<br /><br />I ordered a few different sizes and both orders had issues. When I got the first order, I immediately noticed the manufacturers box had water damage and was ripped apart. As a result, the cans basically fell out in transit and were rolling around in the Amazon box. All were heavily dented and some had rust on them for some reason.<br /><br />As for the second order, the cans and box were in better shape (still some dents), but the expiration date was just 2 weeks away. I have to say, I really ate that I got practically expired products.<br /><br />In the end, I was very disappointed with both orders and wont order Blue Monkey via Amazon any longer.	0
Brothers Complete Is Selling OLD Dog Food!<br /><br />The Beef & Egg currently being sold by Brothers Complete is 13 months old! It was manufactured in February 2013.<br /><br />This is the fraudulent claim being made by Brothers Complete in the FAQ's page on their website,<br /><br />&#34;WHY IS BROTHERS CONSIDERED THE FRESHEST KIBBLE IN THE WORLD?<br /><br />1) &#34;... Within 24 hours of being made, the small batches of Brothers are delivered to it's warehouse where it is kept cool and fresh for the short period of time we have it before shipping it directly to our customers.&#34;<br /><br />If you make a claim like this then how can you sell dog food that is 13 months old?<br /><br />I went to their chat room to ask them why they are selling OLD dog food and they deleted my questions. When other people started asking Brothers why they were selling old dog food and claiming it was fresh, Brothers Complete closed down the chat room and ran!<br /><br />Their customers aren't dumb so they started asking the same questions on the Brothers Complete Facebook page and guess what, Brothers Complete shut down their Facebook page and ran like thieves in the night!<br /><br />Brothers Complete has closed their Facebook page and their chat room rather than publicly address address the issue of them selling old dog food!	1
This is a pretty good little tape dispenser. It's small, easy to fill with tape, and weighted just right. My only problem is that it fell and the metal serrated tab fell out. It took a bit to get it back on. It still works, but beware of dropping it.	1
These horse earrings are so adorable.  They are well made, very detailed and durable.  They hang at just the right length for me, which is always a big issue with me!  Would make a great gift for any horse lover!	1
This device works great as a backup power source and has survived 2 trips across the globe, keeping me charged everywhere. It generally can recharge my iPhone from fully dead to 100% twice before needing to be re-plugged into an outlet for charging.<br /><br />Customers interested in this kind of product need to understand that solar panels of that size are only capable of minimal recharging; the bulk of your power regeneration comes from an outlet. That's not a limitation of this device or manufacturer, it's a limitation of solar technology. As a manufacturer, Levin was outstanding in customer service when I needed to contact them about replacing a part that I broke. I would highly recommend.	0
I have only had this TV for a week, but so far it is working perfectly. The picture is beautiful, set up was easy. Well worth the price and it is on easy pay. I have been with them since they started and I can honestly say that I have only returned 1 item and they replaced it without any problems.	1
Bought these as a present for my boyfriend because he wanted to begin running again.  He loved them.  Loved the color, the fit, and I loved the price.  Would definitely recommend these shoes!	0
When I plug my headset into the controller, the microphone picks up choppy signal. My controller supplied with my PS4 works great, but not this. This doesn't seem genuine.	1
I love my Tundra and only put RP XPS in it.  I was a little disappointed that the shipping of a case(12) was discontinued but the 6 packs with prime shipping are a very good value.  I have to remember to order these a month or so before doing my oil change due to intermittent back orders.<br /><br />P&L	0
What can you really expect from something that does such a simple function? Just make sure that you have the right machine with the right size.	1
The rolling duffle was worth the investment. It withstood the hussle and bussle of being transported from aircraft to aircraft. It is spacious in the main cabin. The nine pockets around the bag makes it great for packing smaller things, or extra clothing.	1
i bought this for my girlfriend. she rarely uses it because according to her, it's great when it rains but during sunny days, it's unnecessary to use a clear umbrella. it cant protect her from the sun.	1
We have kids people, this watch is not going to last long and it did not, bang, bang, agasint walls and the floor. needs to be made of metal or something..	1
I got this as a gift from my wife and im not really liking the fact of walking around with a heart monitor.. but since suffering from heart failure, i know its the right thing to do.. it really works great, clear screen and i have all the needed info on it.	1
The manual is very good at explaining the various options and how to replace-upgrade the internal SATA HDD but, as expected, there's not much advice on the physical layout. Without actually deploying the system by mounting the cameras, I was able to test its features and these are my findings.<br /><br />Cameras are clear and good quality. The remote app really needs improvement. Some days i can see my cameras, while other days i cannot. After several factory resets, i was able to get it to work but is still not 100% reliable. I will only be using these cameras 1.5 months out of the year for my Christmas light show display. I do not want my expensive light controllers to walk away or neighborhood kids messing with my stuff in the yard. This system works great for this, but a long term NVR, i would recommend.	1
Had to send it back because after I loaded my music onto it, it would not play. I like the brand because I had one before and it was great and played great, will have to reorder, since I have paid for this one I sent back, hoping the company will send me another one.	1
I purchased this watch as I found myself taking off all the metal-banded watches when I spent a good amount of time typing. The metal bands were uncomfortable as I rested my wrist on the desk/keyboard. This watch appealed to me as it seemed to be good quality and classy even with a cloth band. I was a little worried at the number of reviews that complained the watch was smaller than advertised.<br /><br />I recieved the watch today and am very pleased. I'm a large man at 6'2&#34; and the watch fits my wrist well. I would never have occured to me to think of the watch as small without seeing the other reviews. Looks like the size of a normal watch to me. Everything seems to be high quality and I'm happy with the purchase.	0
A bit pricey, but excellent quality. Made in Japan, so it's not just some cheap Chinese knock-off. The mic is very sensitive and the amplifier seems calibrated to accentuate voice frequencies specifically, though I can't be sure. Anyway, the voices come through pretty clear, at least through the brick wall I tried it on. Having the mic on a cord (about two feet) is great because you can just tape the microphone to the wall and not have to hold it tight against it all the time. Haven't tried recording yet, but should be possible to have it record to my laptop with the right connector. The outlet on the device is 3.5mm female plug, and so is the microphone plug on the laptop, so it would have to be a 3.5mm male to male cable...	1
Bought this item for a friend's birthday.  She really liked it and put it in her kitchen window where the sun shines the best.	0
perfect size for my new boy - nice an soft material - definitey gonna get a few more in different colors - affordable and great quality	0
This works great for what it is. It can give most of your body a workout, though it is light on the bicep area. I personally combine it with the app (2$) and have had great results so far. I would suggest lowering the app workout to three days a week and lessening the workout a bit to make up for it, but it's fantastic.	0
Bought this item a little over 5 months ago, and have not been disappointed.  The only real down side, if there was one, is that it only comes with two molds.  Even with this we're able to easily make enough average sized snow cones for a family of four (and occasionally 6 when the Grandparents visit).  The machine isn't any louder than you would expect and works as advertised.  I would not hesitate to purchase this again.	0
I love my cover! Bought one for my wife as well. (For her MacBook that is :-)  ) Fast shipping, great product!	0
The taupe color is more of a medium brown in hue. The cover is made of woven polyester with a laminated polyvinyl chloride backing. There is quality evident throughout the piece from the careful top-stitching to the click-close straps that attach to the legs helping secure the cover in place. This is a very handsome way to protect patio furniture from the weather.<br /><br />Included is a brief, but clearly detailed instruction sheet which also includes a care guide. To prevent the protective coating from being removed, the cover should not be cleaned with soap or bleach - just use a soft brush and lukewarm water. Line dry, no iron, and it should not be put away wet to avoid possible mildew. The fabric is not fire resistant so keep it away from hot grills and fire pits.<br /><br />The fabric is reminiscent of a quality back-pack - nothing like the covers I've owned in the past which were more like a vinyl tablecloth or heavy drop cloth. I expect to get years of use from this product.	0
I bought this tool to use for picking up dropped tools, nuts bolts etc...The description says it will pick up 12 pounds. It will not even come close. I dropped a hammer and tried to pick it up. No way this thing will pick up 12 pounds. The head is large and makes you think it is a super magnet. The truth is my little Harbor Freight tool picks up much more.	0
love these nail filers ! i bought a set of the smaller ones for myself and they are the only ones i will use from now on.they are delicate ( i broke one carrying it in my purse ) but if you are careful you will have no problems.i ordered this set here because it has the larger file in it.my hubby is sick and needs his nails done by me.when i used the smaller pointed end ones i stuck it a few times in his toe.but the large round one solved that problem.im sooo happy with this product and would def. reccomend it ...thank you !	0
So, first of all, the ad shows varying colors. The colors I got varied, but THEY WEREN'T THE COLORS ON THE AD. Amazon shows these very light, pastel-like colors. I got bold greens, reds, blues, and purples.  I should know better than to purchase something so cheap, but this was ludicrous. The majority of them wouldn't “lock" into place and the other ones take a ridiculous amount of strength to set. After doing some research, I found an even cheaper (and better quality) brand. Give Clover a shot and don't waste your time with these.	1
And pictures on the same whistle, and I find the same. My goal, I cut the rope, and replaced with a small key ring.<br /><br />How does it sound? If you have a good, fast-paced, loud, rough, sharp, harsh, you can give a good attention for safety reasons, or will soon notice some football player. Be sure not to play at home, it is very easy to make your ears hurt.	1
This watch is a basic watch that affordably accomplishes its task.  It is comfortable to wear and easy to view.  I also like its modest good looks.  You could pay more and get less.	0
This hiking pack is very comfortable to use with plenty of room for your stuff. I've usually used this on my hiking adventures and long drive of biking. After months of rapid used I've noticed that stitches still strong and I think It'll still last long. I have no regrets in buying this and planned to buy a new one with different color this time to blend my other bike. Good deal product!	1
Finally, I have found my dream watch. Thank god I have this. Now my house is under mortgage and my wife left me. I am $2,000 in debt and my furniture is being repossessed. But don't worry when i'm walking to work 23 miles away, ill look fresh as hell.	1
I needed something not bulky and fits all cards and money,  it turned out to be better than I expected. Gave  it 5 stars as it fits the bill.  it's great in  quality for the price. i would highly recommend.	1
Niiiiice! I love this pair, they are so cute. I will wear this on my cousin's birthday celebration. Fine earrings just only for a cheap price,  PERFECT!	1
It is doing what i wanted for the price<br />It basically has three features<br />1) Play your DVDs region free.<br />2) Karaoke<br />3) Convert the CDs into MP3.Saving it in the USB.<br />I have only used it for feature 1 and the feedback is about that.<br />Played around 12 DVDs till now on my Samsung HDTV.Not encountered any problem.The picture quality is excellent.<br />The size is quite compact.<br />People complain about sound.The only sound i hear is when i Eject or Put in the DVD which not loud.Is that really bothersome ? It is not for me.I have seen some reviews which have complained about that.<br />The unique selling proposition is for the Indians who want to buy and take it to India.The power lead which goes in to the socket is the indian variety and for use in america the seller sent it with a U.S adapter.Thoughtful.<br />So when you go back to India this is not something which you will give away to your friend or sell on craiglist.You can actually take it back.	0
It is too flimsy looking and rigid for sensitive baby's skin. I found similar and identical products here on Amazon for less than half the price. They all are made in China, I will do more comparison before buying this one.      http://www.amazon.com/Catcher-Waterproof-Washable-Plastic-Infants/dp/B00NORE1CY/ref=pd_sim_sbs_ba_6?ie=UTF8&refRID=1VEW3D1WM9ZA3JZR03V0  http://www.amazon.com/AMC-Waterproof-Crumble-Catcher-Silicone/dp/B00LL32CBK/ref=pd_sim_sbs_ba_18?ie=UTF8&refRID=0TSPA9FMSPBZ02BGY1B1  http://www.amazon.com/Meily-TM-Waterproof-Infants-Silicone/dp/B00RJM2XAW/ref=pd_sim_sbs_ba_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=02R5RSX85P8E3FYA47JD	1
These flops are the best ever. The zen foam is fantastic and has helped with my heel spurs and back pain. Highly recommend them!	0
I don't know why but after seeing the images and reading this I felt like I wanted to hurl really bad. It was especially annoying since I just ate some excellent sushi and I was not about to waste a good salmon roll.	1
My husband received this from a colleague for Christmas, and it's been a wonderful gift! He's always got a mustache/beard combo going and has been using regular scissors and a manual razor for daily upkeep. This tool just keeps it all convenient with one gadget instead of five, and we can even use it on his hair! It's built really well, too, so you know it'll last for awhile. Norelco is a good brand we've used before - the quality of this grooming system is just what I'd expect from them. Definitely a good investment!	1
I swim about 3 hours a week and the fact that it is possible to listen to music while swimming is fantastic.  For the most part these headphones work as advertised.  If you get a good seal you can listen to music while doing flip turns.  But the seal invariably breaks and then you have to stop and adjust and it gets you out of rhythm.  So, what I am saying is that it is a miracle product that has made me wish for more.	0
I tried to use a cheap substitute on my NEX 6 to avoid buying an expensive flash.  After a dismal failure with a Polaroid wanna be...I wound up ordering this little guy used.  Works perfectly with the NEX 6 with the Universal Shoe.  BUT YOU DO HAVE TO PURCHASE THE Sony ADPMAA Shoe Adaptor for Mi Shoe.  NEX 6 WILL NOT WORK IN TTL MODE WITHOUT THE SHOE ADAPTER.  Love the compactness and speed this guy provides.  A nice accessory for the NEX line of Sony's.	0
This dinnerware set provides a very nice aesthetic. It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer.	1
Heavy and quite a bit bigger folded up than camping chairs that don't have the footrest, so just be aware that you'll need the extra space when packing gear.	0
I was able to reduce my scoliosis because I followed the exercises on this DVD... definitely worth a try for any one with scoliosis. I know how it feels to feel hopeless because of your condition.	1
I would suggest that every woman own one of these! It is a great item to have so that you get a great fit in all your clothing. Especially great for bra fitting and tracking weight loss!	1
This is seriously cute, but the hearts are almost white, like an off-white pink. Also, there was this tiny hard substance stuck to one of the backs of the tiny pearls, but it is hardly noticeable. The locks/backs were rubber instead of what was in the picture, but i prefer it that way anyway.	0
So tasty! I've never ordered a food product before, but I am so very glad I took a chance on this sauce. Has alot of spice and flavor.	0
for one month I Took a pill Before Every time I Ate.  I did Notice a Difference.  After a month I dropped to only 2 Pills Every Morning.  So far in the Two and A Half Months I Have lost 15 pounds.	1
This charging station is so perfect so far, I have 2 wireless controllers and 3 rechargeable battery packs, and this permits me to cycle my battery packs as needed, I always have at least one fully charged.	1
Bought the pair and after 2000 screws I am still using the first bit. Very impressed with their durability.	0
The only place I can get this x-large size of Swiffer sweeper refills is on Amazon so I have to really shop around for a competitive price. I bought a pack of 3 which should last a few weeks. I don't sweep everyday and I also sometimes use the cloths to dust furniture. They're great for that!	0
The quality of these games is amazing, a friend of mine is own of one clothes store recently bought this package of security cams for the office and is incredible how in the distance he can watch each security camera on his android smartphone thanks for the QR code scan. he recently he came here to dinner and show this kind of device security, i took really impressive and now i'm going to talk to my girlfriend to bought and install in our place.	1
I ordered this product from site to store as it was cheaper on the website! It came fast, but when we unpacked it the wire insulation on the drum set was literally falling off! It was like this on the wire to the peddle and on the plugs for the cymbals.	1
I like wearing these glasses..They add little extra to my outfits. I can also used these for photo booth at a party and etc. They look good and fit great. The hinges have that spring loaded feel which is nice and the matte black version that I bought looks really sleek and stylish. For the price it's a great deal.	1
I had already bought a pair from a department store, but they were out when I went to buy another pair. I searched Amazon and using the product number on the inside tag, got another pair just like them. They are the most comfortable jeans I have tried in ages. I am an older gentleman and need room and comfort. They fit good and look good. Definitely worth buying.	0
Very easy to set up. I was able to use 20 minutes after it arrived. This is my favorite fitness purchase in a long time. I love knowing how many calories I'm burning!	0
Excellent game for my son, unbelievable graphics. He is very happy and that is what matters in life!	1
For those who have never tried hint before, you should know that the taste of the fruits is very, very mild - barely noticeable.<br /><br />The product was alright, but I prefer something with a little more taste!	0
Samsonite means quality, if you ask me. Using this bag for quite a while and still looks like new. I love that I have enough space to put most of my belongings when travelling. Couldn't ask for more from a quality product.	1
Used these suction cups to decorate our sliding doors with holiday ornaments and found that they held firmly in place and did the job. Fine product.	0
Picture looks better than the product. The watch looks like a toy or kiddy watch and I returned it right away. My advice: spend few more dollars and get a better looking model. No problem with dealer as he took it back and refunded promptly.	0
I really love this Gold Plated flatware. It is sooo beautiful. I do wish you would see if you can manufacture some matching ice tea spoons. Then the set would be perfect.	1
This is an absolutely essential tool. It works extremely well, it's very effective, and it's super affordable. I own a Siberian husky and he sheds soooo much (as is customary with the husky breed). This comb is a lifesaver with his fur and I recommend it to anyone.	0
I bought one of these for each car. Vey sleek design and quality product, sturdy umbrella. Would fit in a purse or backpack too	0
Very Good Pram for babies aged from 0 - 2 yrs as there are various level adjustments in the seats. Happy and satisfied with the purchase.	1
This is the best book that I found related to dogs and the supernatural. It gives amazing insight into the unknown world of the paranormal.	1
First of all, I was not expecting spectacular results after doing a lot of research about extension tubes and reading other reviews. I currently am an Art major, and my latest medium of choice is kiln-formed glass (you design glass and fire it in a kiln). Anyone knows that glass can be a somewhat difficult subject matter to photograph considering the reflecting and transmitting of light, especially dichroic glass. I currently sell my glass online, and I'm also throughout my schooling, building a portfolio. I really needed a decent camera to capture the depth, different textures and vibrant colors. So I bought a Nikon d5100 and it came with an 18-55mm lens. Great! Still wasn't grasping the textures and layers while photographing at the closest possible distance the lens will allow... Anyway, I have found that for what I need, the 30mm extension tube was more than enough magnification, in fact it was too much. The 20mm hits the spot. It allows my camera to capture every ripple and crinkel in the textures glass, while using AF as well. With the 30mm the AF did not want to perform which was fine I just switched it to manual. The 20mm worked great and I was able to get just inches away from the subject matter. This replaces my need for a macro lens and does the job nicely. It's enough for my website, allows me to beautifully display my glass, and increases my revenue considering photos are everything when you sell online!	0
Most importantly: the night vision does not work at all. The reflection from the IR is so massive that visibility is close to zero. See picture below. The capsule is also VERY heavy and not particularly nice too look at. As wall mount they suggest to use the original Dropcam wall mount, which is fine, but makes the camera somewhat prone to theft.	1
this is really a good product.<br />my hair has become really soft after using the product.smells really good.<br />even my kid like this better.hers is a dry hair but after this hair is very soft and silky.definitely recommend this product !<br />will buy again	0
really like this show its a good one i like ole james bond gets his man and the girl ..everytime!!  enjoyable movie! thanks  Great service thank you!	0
I was really happy with these - they are a great price, and a decent quality. They have a good strength to them, and are stable when you pour the batter in. You don't need a muffin tray underneath like with some others. Recommend these for sure.	1
tried this one too and it didnt work for me. maybe my radio is the devil. i did the software update and heard this one wont work if you do so maybe i shouldnt of did it...	1
This is a very nice outdoor heater, and I use it on my patio. It's very warm so it's great for nights when it gets a little chilly, and I can just sit outside. It looks pretty good also and it's made of durable materials so it won't break!	1
Great price. Quality item. Not for C or larger cups, but the tie front left room to accommodate just fine. Will Definitely buy from merchant again!	0
This is the must have product of the year.  When I traveled this last weekend I used this in replace of my purse and Wow, it was awesome having all my important papers and Id and credit cards all packed into this sleek little pouch and all was safely carried around my neck and no one could steal it and I could not lose it unless I took it off around my neck.  This made my traveling a lot easier and stress free. It kept everything nice and tidy now only if I could do that with the rest of my life!!!	1
Super fast shipping! I love the material it doesn't dig into your skin like other waist trainers & the size chart in the picture accurate. That's the one I used. I am 5'4,my waist size is 32, and I usually wear medium/large. At first I thought there's no way a small was gonna fit but it did, although it might be hard to get it on at first it should fit. I highly recommend measuring your waist to match the size in the picture. I'm so happy with my purchase can't wait to see results!	1
Considering the price, quality and the number of times I need to use it, I give the product a five star.  The quality is not super great and is not super easy to use but the price was low and the product works.  So if I have to use it only once every two years then I think the product deserves five stars.	0
Great rustic addition to our open kitchen. Much smaller that I had thought they would be. I will need to put them on top of something in order to show on the top of my cabinets. Still, really cute.	0
Whenever we go to our vacation house in the country, I always bring something with me to attract the birds and this feed some to do the trick. I always hear them chirping when I wake up there.	1
The camera is pointed straight up. It will not point down at my child. I tried WD40 and even that did not work. I am scared it might break.	1
I bought these pants for one of my groomsmen for our upcoming wedding and they fit him great and he liked the quality of them. They were a great price and I'm happy with them. Great.	1
First let me say that I'm a big Sony fan, but this video camera is very disappointing. It made the video quality of my 8mm look like HD. The footage was only good in the outdoors or brightly lit rooms. It's good for low resolution internet uploads	1
I bought this back pack for my daughter who started second grade this year. She loves it and it holds all of her binders, notebooks, library books, whatever she needs! It has 2 mesh pockets on the side for her water bottle too and fits her small frame perfectly. It appears to be made well and should last through the school year!	1
Its not horrible quality, its OK for the price, in fact its a very very funtional set, i liked the case. But for the price you can not ask for more. Good for me	1
Where to buy the watch bands?<br />1. For Invicta Men's 5515 Subaqua Watch Band<br />2. For Invicta Men's 6583 Subaqua Watch Band<br /><br />E-Mail: eetweilandt@gmail.com<br />Thank you	0
Good read book could have been in better condition, overall though I would recccomd this book to a friend yup	0
I don't understand why people here are giving it two stars when it didn't do anything. If if didn't do anything it was a waste of money and should only get one star.	0
These things weigh almost nothing.  Not sure how long they will last, but my feet feel so much better now.	0
Overall, I think this is a cool product.  I had a lot of fun using it but it was bulky and hard to hold.  Maybe I have tiny hands.  My son wanted to use this so I let him try.  He's 11 and he really wasn't able to do much with it since he had to hold it with two hands but he had fun trying which is what is most important.  I wish this was rechargable so there wasn't a cord.  I did make some fun little things and after about 20 minutes I got the hang of it and it made it easier.  I will be buying more plastic for it because I do like it a lot and think that with some practice I will be able to make some pretty cool things.  There are just some design issues I wish could be addressed which is why I gave it three stars.	1
SIMPLE STYLING,SIMPLE SETTINGS, SOUND REPRODUCTION COMPARES OR BETTER THAN BOSE AT HALF THE PRICE!!! Simply THE BEST TOP OF THE LINE CLOCK RADIO EVER MADE. THANK YOU AMAZON FOR HOOKING ME UP WITH THIS GREAT PRODUCT.	0
This watch has a lot of nice features.  The date is displayed on a white background, smoothly tucked between the 4 and 5 o'clock hour markers.  The watch hacks when setting allowing you to precisely set the seconds.  The chronograph seconds hand smoothly sweeps at 5 ticks per second.  The lume is bright and easy to read in the dark.<br /><br />Light blue accents on the chrono second hand and on the chapter ring at 12, 3, 6, and 9 add a pleasant dash of color.  The lume applied to the hour markers also has a slight blue tinge.  The only criticism of the watch face is that the markers on the running seconds do not match precisely with each tick of the second hand.<br /><br />The weakest part of the watch is the bracelet.  The bracelet makes a jangly sound when you move your wrist due to the hollow end links.  The clasp is of good quality and clicks securely closed.  The bracelet does not have half-links, but the clasp has two micro-adjust settings allowing you to fine tune the fit of the bracelet.  I replaced the bracelet with an after-market leather strap.<br /><br />Overall, I think this is a nice watch with a good set of features.	0
This watch is prettier than the picture shows. Very happy that I purchased this watch.  I believe it is a very good product for a very reasonable price.	1
I use to watch this with my grandparents, and i like it a lot I even picture myself as dorothy when I was a little girl (taking my moms red shoe and clicking the heels) and I just needed to have a copy of the great movie because it just rings me back to my childhood...<br /><br />and also I love watching the beautiful talented judy garland... she is my idol	1
Hanging on the wall it looks good, which is why I got it, however if for some reason if someone ever needs to use it its kinda gross.  There is a nasty black gunk on the ear and mouth pieces.  We tried to wipe it off with some luck but its still there.  We will be trying some solvents to try and clean it up but come on it should have been clean to start.  I would send it back if it was going to be used on the regular but its really for just when the power goes out in case of emergencies so its not worth the hassle.	0
This pink bandana was just as we expected.  We were happy with this purchase.  It completed the costume.  Thank you!	0
This was a great purchase. My husband loves it. I bought it for the iPad 2 that Sanat brought. My husband travels a lot for business and this makes his iPad a lot more useful.	0
I was looking for a waterproof camera but with the cost wasn't sure I could land into buying one. I came across this one, and at a price like this, I was skeptical about the picture quality and features it would allow. However, it proved me wrong and I am happy to have purchased it.	1
Such an elegant necklace. Brings up a classy ambiance when my girlfriend match this with an old style clothing and I don't know why but every time she wears this, It always gives her a big boost of confidence that makes me excited.	1
Enjoying it.  Nice player However, the volume could be louder.Other wise  I would have given 5 stars.	0
We bought one of these for a studio task lamp and were so pleased, we decided to get another for an office desk. The second one came with a small locking washer having fallen off but it was a snap to replace. The lamps work perfectly and were just what we needed.	1
One of the few downsides of CA glues, is that they can set inside the nozzle or cap. Being able to replace the nozzle and/or cap can provide significant savings.	0
I was really disappointed because the watch strap was broken, I wish I could return it but I'm out of USA	0
This product works nowhere near as well as they make it look on T.V. unless you like the smell of overheated metal parts being overworked to try to achieve the results seen on T.V. and leaky elements, I wouldn't recommend this at all!	1
After searching on-line, and in local retail sporting goods stores, the BEST price available was on the web site. The product quality and performance rival much more expensive products. They work as advertised when shooting at the range, and are also great when working with noisy power tools, lawn mower, and lawn tractor.	1
After initial installation was very concerned that I made a mistake by purchasing this television but after a couple of weeks the picture just gets more amazing after each day of use.	0
I used to have terrible scars from acne and with this my scars vanished within a few weeks. This cream works extremely well and efficiently and is easy to use. All it takes is daily application of the cream and your scars will no longer be noticeable. Definitely worth the purchase.	1
These microfiber cleaning towels are doing a great job and they also treat the paint suface with great care. However, they wear very fast. Mybe I am doing something wrong, but one clioth doesn't resiste more than 2-3 cleanings.	1
Although these bulbs are classified on the package as &#34;soft white&#34; light they give off very cold white light.  They are quite bright, with 4100k which I like, but the &#34;color&#34; of the light is very stark and not soft at all.  I much prefer the Ecobulb softwhite 15w equivalent 2700k bulbs for home use.	0
Item as described, shipped quickly, good quality parts. Fitment perfect for a 1999 k1500 Suburban bolted right on in 20 minutes.<br /><br />Truck rides a little firmer now, ride height looks the same to me. I'm very happy with the results, truck rides well.	0
I am sick of disposable umbrellas.  I wanted a sturdy umbrella that would hold up to wind and I could tuck into my briefcase.  This is more convenient than a traditional golf umbrella in that it collapses, but as previous reviewers have commented it is on the large size.  I have a nylon briefcase/bag and this does fit in it, but not discretely--it projects out the top.  However, as I travel by foot among several buildings this is useful to have available.  I am willing to trade length for functionality (the extra panel for wind) .  I wear glasses and absolutely detest getting water on them, hence the desire for an umbrella (I never know when a rain shower will pop up).  Also the pattern (blue and white) makes it obvious, which is helpful in the dark or reduced visibility situations. I was once almost hit by a car while in a cross walk because I was wearing a dark coat and they just didn't see me.	0
Excellent product.  I had some irritation over my eye and was worried about using a cream as it may drip into my eye and cause even worse irritations.  This product cleared it up after two or three applications.  I still use it to smooth my skin.	0
So was my granddaughter. Got this for her at Christmas and she was so happy!! Said it was better than her step brothers music stand. Well made for the price, and I will be buying at least two, maybe three, more for my other musicians in the family.	0
This game came with everything that I needed<br />he game  plays well and has alot of fun add-ons LOVE !!	0
I should have known that something like this wouldn't likely give off a lot of light but I wasn't thinking which is why I got this for a newly added room in our house. My dad gave me the responsibility I blew it. He was a sport about it though.	1
great design and colors used on this mouse. I tried it without a mousepad and it works just as fine.It feels great in your hand ,unlike my previous mouse, glad it got this at a great price as well. The programmable buttons are great for multiple tasks as well.	1
These screws work great if you dont need stainless steel.  The best features are  what they dont do which is corrode, strip, or snap at the shanks.  I still dont understand the the switch to the star bits, they strip very easily and square drives like these are very hard to find in stores.	0
My phone bounces instead of breaking. And I do not have to worry about ordering another phone because of the manufacturer.	0
I like the fact that this bag can be used as either a shoulder bag or back pack. The material seems sturdy enough and will update if this fails during actual travel. Haven't used it but again the material and construction seem well built.	0
3/8&#34; is the perfect size. On the things I sew , i usually have 1/2&#34; hem so 5/8&#34; and 1/4&#34; are either too small or too large and this size is harder to find in the stores.	0
The box looks nice and is covered in soft leather. Problem is I have two watches with large faces and the slots are too close together to keep the watches from touching each other.	0
This works a lot better, akd is bigger than I thought it would be. Works extremely well on my lemons. And i used it on cheese today as well as it shaved it perfectly	1
Great looking glasses. Old school style and they are more comfortable to use. Well made glasses and another great product from oakley!	1
My wife got me this for christmas and I'm so happy with it. After initial setup the Xbox and Kinect are a great pair. I originally didn't want the Kinect but I've found its pretty cool and probably will have some cool uses down the road. My Xbox did slow down and freeze during downloads so I suggest only downloading one game or thing at a time. I was doing six and it was clearly too much. That being said it runs great now.<br /><br />Getting both assassins creed games with it is also a tremendous deal.	0
Bow and Stern Fenders sometimes don't cut it with high winds and high doc sides, common in the Northwest.  I have these in the gunnels tied to mini black fenders and they get deployed instantly when my larger fenders for and aft can't hang.  Get'em, read the directions and practice.	0
Be Safe, Be Seen with this high quality safety vest! Whether it be road crew, school crossing guard or even an avid hunter! With this neon colored vest you will be spotted in most all situation's day or night as it is also light reflective with the 3M Scotchlite reflective tape. A must have.	1
Ive used this bag for two trips so far, and I have no real complaints yet. I bought it to use for frequent international travel. So far, it has shown no signs of damage. The only thing that was surprising is that one of the sides is not reinforced - It just kind of bulges if you have too much stuff or you can push the fabric in. I guess its just one less thing to break, but I found that odd.	1
Installed this on my 2014 Ford Fusion with the baby 1.5 eco boost. Fits like a glove, gives the car a little more growl then stock, did notice a little less hesitation and a little quicker spool time. Don't think my fusion will be beating a Mustang anytime soon but for a grocery getter it'll do.	0
The Actiontec GT701D Ethernet DSL Modem with Routing Capabilities didn't work out. The software indicated that it installed correctly but shortly after installation, I received a message from AT & T noting that there was something wrong with the Actiontec GT701D Ethernet DSL Modem and that they didn't support it! The Actiontec modem was really slow and after 15 minutes finally stopped! I re-installed my old SIEMENS SPEEDSTREAM 4100 and got back on the internet! I returned the Actiontec to AMAZON.COM who credited my account.	0
Poor quality, the button just broke instantly after a month. Just a waste of money, not glad with this.	1
This is a great gadget, really a must-have! I bought this so I know what my child is doing in his room over day. This makes me have a safe feeling because he is in his room all day on his pc. I can now sit in my sofa downstairs and I don't have to worry about my son anymore. The quality is very good, and I really like the way it works, everything is so smooth and handy!	1
This oil really did wonder for my skin and hair! I would recommend it to anyone. It came in a glass bottle with a dropper very well packaged. And for an unbeatable price!	1
Terrific product. Shipped very quickly. Was exactly as described. While not really expensive, the price was definitely worth the quality!	0
Exceptional honey syrup,medicated for weight loss.It is very delicious and energetic .<br />As it is an organic product ,there are no side effects .Definitely recommend it to everyone who want to loose weight, feel and look better.	1
Bought it as kind of a  door proper. Just something to keep by the main entrance just in case if ya know what I mean. Seems solid the wood scratches very easily the blade is a little sharper than I figured it would be but it won't cut paper. The tip is deadly. Not sure if its full tang or not but it feels solid. All in all not amazing but not bad.	0
I bought these for work.  I have high arches, so I use an arch support.  The heels are not too high.	0
I'm expecting, but I don't want to invest in all new bras yet.  These extenders are the perfect solution.  And when you compare the cost to purchasing new bras, you can't beat it.	0
There are many infuse botle waters out there but in my opinion this one is the best, all my fruits fit int he slots and its easy refillabe, Also the size its actualy perfect, not heavy so can be taken everywhere, the best its the it comes with a booklet so you know what to actually do witht his infusser, this is a great buy, at a great price. I highly recommend this infusser to everyone.	1
Good one, best one for those who prefers white for all. That steel colour dial part seems like getting minute scratches...Go for white only if u can keep it white. Clean everyday. Not as glossy as u see in the pic.	1
i buy this playstation controller for my brother. he like it too much. and its really good.Recommend to everyone!:) :) :)	1
I love the car and love the fact that my son also like this and happy!  ....awesome !!recommended to others..buy thsi	1
There's no way that the creators should get away with this. Calling this overpriced is such an understatement the word actually scoffs at how ridiculous it sounds. Really?	1
I was surprised at how well packaged these tables were. The quality was great for the price; the color was exactly as advertised. They came all put together, they are nice and well worth the money. They are exactly what I wanted.	1
I am giving this 4 stars because of the packaging. I bought another decal for more money and it came rolled up in a tube. This decal was folded in half to fit in an envelope and the words were bent. We laid it flat under a book over night to get the wrinkle out, but once we applied it to the wall, you can't tell.<br />You have to be VERY careful when applying and go really slow, inch by inch or else the letters won't transfer to the wall and will stay stuck on your paper.	0
As i go oftenly outdoor i always wanted a good and a strong camera to record all my moments and this camera met all my requirements as this camera is strong as i droped this camera once and nothing happened to eat not even a scratch as it is waterproof i recorded many videos in water too which are amazing,satisfying purchase	1
The 8100 Pro is just a printer.  That's all it does. But, it does it so well!  As a teacher, my wife does a lot of high volume printing.  Print speed and ink cartridge life are paramount. This printer delivers. While your average inkjet printer will deliver 7 pages per minute, this one shoots pages out at 20+ per minute.  Even at high resolution settings, it's still 3X as fast as any other injet we have. Two sided printing is slower as it takes a small break after printing the first side to allow the ink to dry before running the page through for side 2.<br /><br />Print cartridges reportedly hold about 10ml color and 20ml black.  They last a very long time. They can also be refilled if you choose to do so. If you do use recycled or refilled cartridges, just push "OK" when the printer points out you're not using a genuine or refilled HP cartridge. I've found unplugging newer HP printers, while removing and refilling cartridges, eliminates those warnings all together. Probably depends what firmware is on board.<br /><br />Setup was easy and only took a few minutes to get the printer on our wireless network and available to all 5 computers in the house. No problems encountered with Vista 32 or 64 bit or Windows 7 OS. No problems printing pictures from Windows Photo Gallery. It's a good, fast printer.	0
This stand is sturdy. The only problem is that it's hard to tighten the screw that holds the top steady.	0
This is the perfect tool if you want to produce the perfect dough like in the 5 minutes Artisan Bread book. I could not make bread this way without this dough whisk, as it mixes the ingredients so well in no time at all, plus it is easy to wash.	0
I purchased this burner and got the next day $3.99 shipping through prime so I could brew a batch quickly...not disappointed at all!<br /><br />The assembly was easy and quick. It is sturdy and man...does it kick out some heat. I didn't need to push it all the way for my purposes. I used about 1/2 power and had 8 gallons of hose water boiling in 24 minutes! That was with a lid on.<br /><br />When it came time to boil my wort, it worked great. I didn't time it, but it was quickly up to boiling, and I had about 7.5 gallons going. It could easily handle more, I just don't have a pot big enough to test it.<br /><br />The great part is that there is room to grow with this burner. I have a 9 gallon pot that is pretty wide, and I have the adjustable base set to the narrowest setting. I could get a 15 to 20 gallon pot on top of this burner very safely. It is rock solid and can handle a lot of weight.<br /><br />The wind baffles work well, too. It was a relatively windy day, and I was able to adjust the baffles with tilt to keep the wind from affecting the flame too much.<br /><br />I can't tell how much propane it is using up yet, as I have only one batch under my belt, but my calculations tell me that at 105,000 BTU, you will burn through a standard 20 lb. propane tank in 4 hours. As I said, I was probably going half power on the first batch, since I was getting used to the burner...so I plan on 6 to 8 hours of burn time per tank. Time will tell. This should be plenty for a couple of batches, so I am planning on spending about 10 dollars on propane per batch.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this burner...no complaints whatsoever.	0
I got the burgundy color to match my larger luggage. I haven't had a chance to use this luggage yet, but it looks sturdy & well made & is very pretty. I'm looking forward to having stylish matching luggage when I use it in 2 weeks.	1
Loved this show as I was growing up, and now that I have watched it again, and  getting into it again, I find I like it as much as I did then,....reliving my childhood days and remembering when times were easy and fun......	0
I bought these after reading the positive reviews previous customers left. I am very pleased with the quality of the product, ease of installation, and price. We purchased a new home and every window has these blinds in them. I gave this a 3 because the crown valance won't work in my windows, so I wish there was an option to have the valance cut straight. Other than that, great!!	1
Excellent product. Actually saved a battery I was having problems with before. My batteries refused to charge, but with this, it got it right back to charging(the charge cables could have been bad, not sure). It's small, takes little space, and charges batteries within hours. Great little product for the price.	0
The bracelet is a fine sterling silver chain, well worth the money.  Very delicate chain and would be an excellent accessory to casual or cocktail wear. It would make an excellent gift, as it can be used when using casual wear or dress wear.  Make sure you buy the right size chain when considering it as a gift for someone, as the nine inch chain is very large.	0
Bad experience all the way around. Didn't get the items at the same time.. And once received they didn't hold a charge as good as it should have. The picture was of a black battery when in fact I was sent a white battery. Worst experience ever...	1
waste of time... baterries die in 30 minutes if you listen to music...thats is not what say when i buy	0
This ring looks better in picture in person is so thin and diamonds too small looks beautiful but if you have a big fingers I don't recommended I have small fingers and I can barely notice I have it on :(	1
Loved it. I grew up reading comic books, as a kid the campiness worked, the PG feeling made sense. I still love comic books and comic book movies, but I no longer want the camp and the tackiness that comes with them. DC and Marvel have done a great job scaling it down, but out of the two, DC takes the cake. Assault on Arkham is a great example of that. Bad guys, killers, psychos going into an Asylum, you have to expect hard language, sexuality and violence, and the movie delivers. I hope DC continues this pattern.	1
Absolutely love!  I can wear with many outfits as it contains so many colors.  It fits great and was so reasonably priced!	0
At least it doesn't leak unlike the one that I got last time. I slipped and nearly broke my tailbone because of it.	1
Typical K&N filter.  Fits great and has worked like it should.  Don't think I got any mpg increase out of the filter which is fine.  The not having to buy a new paper filter every other oil change is nice.  It has more than paid for its self.	0
Once I got past the installation part I really fell in love with our Diono. For some reason I struggled with the install instructions (probably because there are so many options as this is a very versatile seat). The seat is narrow enough to allow plenty of room for other children/seats/booster and is definitely well constructed. I feel my little one is very safe using his Diono and as I promised my husband &#34;this is the last car seat we will ever need!&#34;	0
I love the loose fit and flow of this top. The cap sleeves and neck line add a cute element. That a regular tshirt doesn't.	0
I buy these pads to use as puppy potty pads for my 2 small dogs but these tend to come apart when I used for my puppies. I prefer the green or blue ones over these. They are small and not real absorbent.	1
Sold set from a solid company, Tekton has always been a pretty good of high quality tools and parts. It's a good thing my dad gave me this instead of his old one. They were good, but not as good as these IMHO.	1
It's cheap but I don't think I will buy this again. The paper is so very thin. It works for printing personal stuff, but not for business use.	1
Having this fan on my porch is quite nice, especially during summer when staying indoors is uncomfortable. It isn't perfect however, so don't expect a lot of wind. It will simply blow the worst of the heat away.	1
I hated these Oreos. They sucked. They were just sucky Oreos. One of them fell in the milk and now I'm bitter. They were actually really good. Sorry for wasting your time	1
With a very inexpensive eSata PCI-e card, this enclosure works fine on my Mac Pro with 4 Seagate 1TB drives.  Delivered promptly and price was good.  My only issue is that one of the LED's on the front that indicates drive usage appears to not work.  I'm sure I could have returned it for a replacement but I decided not to do that as it didn't effect the usage of the device.  Enclose also came with a full range of cables.	0
I purchased the watch. The watch is very pretty. The face is large and sits flat on the wrist as described. It's going back though because the band is too big. I don't think i should have to poke a hole in the band. It's just not a good value for me.	1
the gray rubber wasnt fully covering the hard plastic on the bottom of case. sorta like a piece of bottom was missing	0
What a relief that there are still some writers willing to push language to its limits.  This book pleases on many levels, from biting satire to goofball antics to startling philosophy. An inspired debut, like Kurt Vonnegut or Tom Robbins but only because there's really no one else doing this kind of thing.	1
Been using this book for about a year, and if you are mechanically driven (You work better with formulas than concepts) this book is a God send.	0
Simply can't find a complaint about the Vizio 47. Picture quality at least equal to my Samsung 55 and am very pleased with the sound quality. Extraordinary value for the money. Decided to buy American and didn't have to give up a thing to do so.	0
I like weight with the material used for my sport equipment.  If you dropped a match on this material it would burn through before you could do anything about it.  Wouldn't recommend it to a friend...but would recommend it to an enemy.	0
I have used Missing Link before for my Irish Setters.  This is the first time I've used Missing Link for Skin and Coat.  It takes at least 3 weeks to begin to see the benefits but my Irish Setters' skin is much less itchy than before.  I had used medicine to stop the Irish boy's itching but that didn't seem to have lasting results but the Skin and Coat has improved both of Irish "kids'" skin.  The flakiness is improving as well.  This is not an overnight cure but if given at least three weeks, this product will improve a dog's skin and coat.	0
We bought this for our outdoor plants before we disappeared for a week to a vacation. At that time, weather here was dry and hot and no rain was forecast for the whole week, so we needed to provide the plants with some water.<br />The watering system worked as it should - when we came back, the plants were alive and looked rather well.<br />Set-up of the system is very easy, but due to the limited length of the water hose, you either need to compile your plants within the reach of this unit, or you have to buy more than one unit.<br />Our plants that needed the week long water treatment are all moveable, so we clustered them in an area of approximately 5 by 5 feet directly adjacent to the solar unit, which we attached to a rain pipe with the provided plastic bands.<br />Of course, being solar powered, it is paramount that the unit has access to sunlight, but in pour case this was only true for maybe four hours a day in the afternoon. Still, this and the rechargeable batteries you need to put in (not provided!) kept the unit going.<br />Another consideration is the flow rate of the water, which can be chosen variably. But the more water you let flow through the system, the bigger your tank has to be. Not everybody has a 50 gallon drum readily available, and we eventually had to settle for an old 20 gallon plastic container. we set the flow rate to a very low level and calculated that this would do the trick. It did. When we came back, the container was only half empty and our precious hibiscus and the other plants were in great shape.<br />So, this is certainly not a 1-2-3 solution - it needs a bit planning and preparation with placement, water supply and flow rate, but once you have figured it all out, it works perfectly.<br />We did not bother to remove the system after we got back from our vacation, but left it - and the plants -  in place. It just looked good the way the plants were arranged - though more out of necessity than of aesthetic reasons at first - andthe solar powered unit, after over one month of constant use, still supplies them with a steady stream of water.<br />Out of our experience, we can highly recommend this product.	0
An amazing and good looking watch. It is not diss appointing at all and it's good to look at at night with the space dark light. It is cheap compared to its look. I recommend it to all that love Gold looks	0
Worth the price payed for it. The interior linen looks so thin, I dont think it would last for long.	0
Tried the product twice a day for the whole filling of the unit, but did not see any results to call some progress. Sorry to say so! I can apply this without doing a juggling act, thanks!!	1
There was a little when it arrived.<br />There was a broken piece ratting around in the control.<br />And sometimes interferes with the left trigger.<br />Not recommend.	1
Awesome camera! I love having the capability to send pictures from my camera directly to my phone. I went hiking with it and took pictures and was able to send them to my phone while still in the woods. I bought this for my trip to the UK this summer and I know it'll be perfect. I wanted something small enough to fit in my purse and also didn't run on AA or AAA batteries and this ticks off all my must haves! I would definitely recommend this camera to anyone wanting a good, small camera.	0
Broke within a week. Very disappointing . Went to best buy and got a new one . Sorry cant rate it more then 2 star !	1
This waist bag is so much sleeker than the classic bulky fanny bag. I was really skeptical it could hold all the things I wanted to take with me.  But I was really surprised as it took my mobile, wallet and keys, with plenty of other places left to stash even more things!  I was really amazed to see how much the fabric could stretch!  I love the feel of the fabric, which is water proof, as I've tested it and everything stayed dry.  Love the patriotic theme!	1
This set is worth the money. The best mask and snorkel I ever use. The mask is very comfortable and can be easily adjust. No water leaking. It works great. The mask gives me a clear vision and I can see clearly. recommend it to anyone who is looking for a snorkeling set.	1
If you need assistance in recalling all those English rules, this is the book to have! Highly recommend the seller also. Book was like brand new. Prompt in sending.	0
This stuff works great as long as you use only one spray. It has a light lavender scent. Kitty will be calm and quiet as long as she stays on the spot where I sprayed it. She starts meowing again once she walks away, but it's still worth it.	0
I had earlier bought Dr. Navadia's ECG Short Rapid Review , it was awesome and was searching some books related to Cardiology. I came across many books with more than 20 , five star comments..... Wait !!!! How can be that much feedbacks in a week and then rest of 6-12 months , not a single feedback ? All of which were self reviewed and so thought to buy this book after seeing Table of Content in it. Never go on feedbacks.<br /><br />And as usual , Dr. Navadia's book rocks ...I am a medic & i find this book explains every thing what a medic must know - It explains all relationships , drugs , non-pharm therapy etc . see table of content for more details.<br /><br />For common people, there is more than enough information which might be not usefull for them. DASH Diet is explained in short summary in 2-3 Pages (Go for detailed DASH Diet book if u want to move with it). So for them i would give 4 star for this book ...but for medics i will give 5++ star.<br /><br />In short , i would say , if u want to know more , go for this book , you will not regret your purchase , Thats my opinion... but if u just want to know only How to manage without doctors advice or only few things , then , better buy another book.	1
I bought a lighting deal bungle with this and the Sharp LC-60C7500U for $1,300. Amazing deal! This sounds bar puts out quality sound with a variety of different settings (movie, news, music, etc.) and the subwoofer provides nice bass. So much so that I have to turn it off at times because I'm worried my neighbors below are getting annoyed. I think this is worth the full price but anything under $200 and it is a screaming steal. The one thing I would like to point out is that someone recommended using an optical cable. I bought one, hooked it up correctly and switch the sound bar to optical cable but no sound came out. Not sure if mine is defective but I definitely set everything up right and it didn't work. Instead I used an HDMI cable the sound is thumping.	0
Love the leather and the awesome look.It's really fashionable and so comfortable.Very easy to carry and the capacity is huge!!! So basically it can be carried anywhere and you can show this bag off anywhere you go! Leather is really luxurious and the design just perfect.	1
This water carrier is amazing. Just got one of this product and its pretty cool for me since traveling is my hobby. The 5 gallon water carrier has spigot cap for easy filling and dispensing, which makes it easier for me to fill without spilling.  The handles are strong enough to carry 5 gallons of water , when empty it could be packed easily as like to some piece of cloth because it's flat foldable and able to be compressed into a smaller  form. Great for camping and fishing trips, no more bulky gallons to carry.	1
For just 2 dollars you can have this memory card carrying case. Looks durable and made up of high quality materials. It keeps my cards stored in 1 place.	1
It clips on your visor and holds all types of frames. So I no longer have to go fishing thru my console when  need my sunglasses or night vision glasses.	0
Great quality. Awesome sound for such a small device. Also charges my iPhone while its on there. Listen to music and charge your phone at the same time. Doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter. Highly recommend this.	0
Fan-Freaking-Tastic  My girl got me this and I laughed and now I'm serious with a beard. I can not vouch for this enough as I have not been able to grow a connecting beard since forever. I'm 32 and I should be able to have a beard and now I do. GREAT GREAT GREAT Product.	1
Wow,this service is simply amazing! All you need to do is get one of their XBMC keys and install the program on your computer devices and then you will gain access to over 600,000 videos all in the palm of your hands. This will save you so much money as you won't have to pay any more monthly bills for cable or satellite TV. Would recommend this to everyone.	1
Ok so we tried this, and it did not work. It has to be totally fake, at least the claims. Not approved by the FDA is my guess? Can't you just picture the guy saying "Cures Rickets!" from the back of a train to some local town. Snake oil is a better description in my humble opinion.	1
It came fast, we installed but the problem in my F-150 continues but  nothing to do with the fuel pump, that came perfect.	0
Revised review (see original below)  I recommend you not buy this product because of the Omron planned obsolescence policy.  Within a year or so of purchase, the bladder and tubing failed.    I phoned Omron customer service to purchase replacement bladder and was told to buy a new unit.  This is not the first time one of these units lasted only a year or two for me even though used as directed.  Original review was as follows:  The cuff is really wide.  I'm 6'1&#34;, and it covers my upper arm.  Compared to my 15 year old lumiscope 13&#34; cuff, the readings are a little higher (not lower), but the arm to arm reproducibility is better.  I can't explain it, but although I think it's a little less sensitive, the ear sounds are louder.  Maybe less high frequency and louder bass.  I recommend this brand because the construction is sturdy (less good than the old lumiscope, but I can't find that).  Compared to other cuffs available from Amazon:  The $25 and under nylon bladder cuffs I have tried don't work at all.  My last cuff from amazon was made of cheap chinese rubber and decayed in two years (check that there is a long warrantee; this one had limited 1 year parts).  The Majestic has a latex bladder and I was hopeful enough after having spent a lot of time shopping for something like my lumiscope that I purchased a second as back-up.  The weak point of the unit may be the cords, and I suppose they are replaceable.  I haven't yet checked for replacement parts	0
This game really won my kids' hearts, and I had a blast playing it as well.  I don't want my children on the iPad all the time, so this was a way in which I could have them be more active but still enjoy the ever-popular angry birds.  It's been a blast and we're definitely going to play when all the cousins are over this holiday season!	1
I really like this watch, it fits well on my wrist and is very durable. No scratches or dents after almost 4 months of use. Very well fitting and very sleek and beautiful. It's great for its price!	1
Good quality I recommend to any one to buy this calipers fit perfect on my old trek road bike breaks on a penny	0
First, I bought this through digital purchase on the Blizzard website, but I think getting as much negative press out there to prevent more gamers from falling for this ponzi scheme is important.<br /><br />Warning: If you purchase this game, you are willingly becoming a human node to farm profit for Blizzard. The game is designed completely around the need for the real-money auction house to compete and do well in the end-game. The difficulty curve in the final stages of the game is so absurd and the loot system is so obscenely weighted against you in terms of probabilities to actually receive an upgrade, that you have no choice but to farm for hours on end to afford to purchase upgrades from the auction house. This game could have been named: "The World of Auctions" and it would have at least not been as big a let down as slapping the Diablo franchise on the front of the box.<br /><br />One month into the game, Blizzard releases the real money auction house. Now the auction house that uses the in-game currency (Gold) is a barren wasteland of good loot. It's meh-mediocre at best. Anything very good to great gets slapped on the Real-money auction house for 25 bucks or more, sometimes 250 bucks. It's ridiculous. But here's where Blizzard's greed starts to shine through. They get $1 for every successful Real-money auction. So there's no incentive for them to fix their broken game experience. They'll just sit back and watch desperate people trying to squeeze an ounce of fun out of their game by spending their real income on virtual garbage. Did a champion pack with aggravating affixes just demolish you repeatedly? Why not spend 5 bucks on this amulet to improve your chances?<br /><br />Then there's the fact that the real-money auction earnings either dump directly into a blizzard balance that you have to spend in their digital store, or you can transfer it through paypal to your account. Paypal takes their cut, and I wouldn't be surprised if Blizzard owns some part ofPaypal through subsidiaries.<br /><br />Soon, even the in-game currency will be available for purchase through their real-money auction house. They couldn't figure out how to make a game that the Chinese wouldn't farm and sell virtual goods in, so they just embraced it, and now they're going to get their cut at least.<br /><br />Just do yourself a favor, go play something else. This game is nothing but a money grab in a somewhat pretty looking but poorly developed gaming experience.	1
I put only a tiny amount on my face, it made my face shiny and oily looking, which I don't like. I have several same brand of oils and glycerin, they are all in 16oz bottles, the labels are exactly the same except the product names, even the font styles are the same, so it is difficult to tell which one is which when I put them all together on the shelf. I suggest the different-looking labels (different colors, pictures, and font styles) for different oils, such as almond oil, jojoba oil, vegetable glycerin, etc. Right now, they all look the same, which is confusing.	1
It does what it's supposed to. The only reason I gave it four stars is because the little strings on the seeming started to come off after i opened the packaging but it wasn't anything I couldn't fix myself over all its a good case and shipping was great	0
This is not a mask for any serious divers. I used this mask and on the FIRST DIVE!!! the damn cheap rubber strap broke on me!; when I was at my safety stop and clearing my mask. For $80 dollars you would think they could use a quality strap with maybe some neopreme on the back?<br /><br />This is what I had to end up doing and after that the mask does function as stated so that is why I am giving it two stars	1
this is a beautiful spread and I love it but it is a bit too long and not wide enough it is missing about 3 in. for a cal. king	0
awesome product very good finishing .due to a small house i cant afford an extra space so this thing satisfy our need	1
The truth nothing to envy of other lenses. The crystals are spotlessly maintained and best of all, you don't fog up. For those days of tortuous sun in which you want to protect your vision a pair of these helps a lot. Recommended.	1
Easy to wash and easy to dry. The size is just nice for a little bit of snacks. Do note that these type of bags will not keep certain foods fresh for long periods. E.g. nuts, chips tend to lose its crunchiness and crispness because it is not airtight.	0
The formula has been great. We've been using it for 6 months and have had no problems. However, the new packaging is terrible. After the aluminum safety seal is removed it leaves a sharp edge and my husband and I have both cut our hands on multiple containers multiple times.	1
Quality not that good. Don't expect too much from this product, it is cheap for a reason. With that said, as long as you don't fill it up more than half way and with items that are very hard to chop, it works great.	1
this product was a soak and put up product. Description said "peel and stick" - it is not a peel and stick but it was easy to put up. Also the picture shows everything in yellow but it is actually beige, green and yellow.	0
The bag looks great and the material/zippers, etc. appear to be good quality. The only issue I have is that the retractable handle is a bit too short. I am not tall (5'7&#34;), and I have to bend over slightly to pull it along. If the handle were about 3 inches longer, it would have been perfect.	1
The guys (6'3 & 6'5&#34;) both around 210 - 220 pounds noticed a real difference over the store bought boards.  Better support, longer runs.  We didn't have great waves, but they were still able to get long rides.	0
Great one knife choice, if you can only take one.<br />I would feel very prepared and safe with this as my &#34;one knife&#34; choice.	0

UPDATE - February 2, 2015    After I wrote my review the manufacturer of this bag had the bag redesigned so that the zipper opening runs the full width of the top of the bag (and then a bit) to allow for easy insertion of your computer.  A copy of the new version landed on my porch yesterday. Kudos for a great response!  (Now if they had only changed that lining!)    ORIGINAL REVIEW    I love the look of this stylish black/dark gray denim [[ASIN:B00QM3BH0G Casual Messenger Crossbody Bag Shoulder Bag]]. Loaded with pockets and zippered compartments, the bag features a diagonal zipper compartment on the top flap and an adjustable strap of heavy duty webbing.  The bag is well constructed of mostly heavy duty materials and features attractive antiqued brass metal fittings.  There are, however, some things that I do not like about this bag.    First, the product page gives the bag's dimensions as 14.8x11.8x4.3 inches and clearly states that the bag will hold a 15 inch laptop.  I know of no way at all that one can fit 15 inches of inflexible material into a space only 14.8 inches long.  Clearly, this must be a typo.  Accordingly, I tested the bag on both my daughter's 14 inch Alienware computer and a 13.3 inch netbook.  The 14 inch Alienware simply would not go into the bag, no matter how we turned it. (The zipper opening is only about 12 inches.)  I did get the netbook into the bag by putting one corner in first and then turning the device, but the case did scrape against the zipper.  Frequently putting the netbook into the bag and removing it would certainly result in a severely marred netbook case.  An iPad does fit adequately.    The exterior of the bag is made of 100% cotton denim, which makes it washable.  The lining, however, is a heavy, brown, not particularly attractive nylon of not-particularly great quality.  The two fabrics have different shrink rates, so while you can in theory wash this bag, you can also expect to find your lining larger than the bag itselfafter you do so.  A cotton fabric would have been much more attractive and easily eliminated that problem.    Grandma's $0.02 - Nice stylish, heavy duty bag.	0
I purchased a show case for my prized possession, my new Gibson Lucille.  I had BB King sign it for me and it's now cradled in this swing inside the case over my couch.  This worked out well after doing a few modifications to make it fit inside the case.  It works though and looks good.  If you are going to just hang a guitar on the wall, this is perfect with no modifications needed.<br />If I trust my &#34;Lucille&#34; probably valued well in excess of 10 grand in it, you should too.<br />This was padded in all of the right places so my prize won't get scratched.	0
Easy to put up and looks a little different from the average towel bar  A modern look I would call it.	0
No word can describle my love!!! It's so cute. My boyfriend said it suited me very well.This is a happy exprience.	1
I bought this watch for my wife and she loves it. Its very inexpensive, but it doesn't scream cheap. I would recommend this to anyone. The only small issue I had was that the back plate on the watch was a bit loose. I contacted the seller and he sent me a replacement that was in perfect condition right away.	1
$15 bucks and I got a set of headphones that actually fit my kids heads.  WORTH!<br />Definitely not disappointed at all.	0
To be honest I was nervous about ordering it but it came so quickly and I am so happy with the fit and everything about it!	1
I think this is one of the most functional bags I ever bought from Amazon. It suits a lot of my activities. The bag is quite spacious and enables me to carry a lot of my personal belongings such as laptop, documents, pens, chargers and USB cables.<br /><br />I can carry the retro messenger bag either under my hands or on my shoulders. Either way, the bag feels soft on my body. I don't use a lot of effort when carrying all my personal items.<br /><br />The bag looks seems to be very old fashioned design but I like it that way. The only issue I have with this retro messenger bag is the pocket on the flap part. I don't think this pocket is necessary given the bag has many other pockets.	1
These cords are exactly what I was looking for! I was so tired of cords being in the way when I try to plug my pedals together to play. I wanted something that would actually fit the area, but not end up with a bunch extra that you end up stepping on or messing up. When my husband found these for me, I was so excited! They plug right in, and work great. Definitely what I needed.	1
My feline partner ate it up quickly I have to say, but she was energetic and as full of herself as always. When is the calming part supposed to happen?	1
I needed 2 more of this chair to replace my broken chairs  for my current dining table. So far it's all good !	1
Tried this product last night. Not on my cast iron skillet but on a cooked on greasy, BBQ sauced cookie sheet. After making BBQ ribs, cleaning was a cinch. Soapy water and scrubbing easily remove the gunk. It even removed some older gunk that didn't come off with just sponge washing from past cooking. Superb idea and product!	0
This is terrible and not in a way that would have been subtle either. The blatant clashes of interested are so strong here that I wonder how the authors ever managed to agree on having it published. These people should get a grip.	1
Great quality lemon/lime squeezer. This thing works very well. We have an old plastic squeezer that we bought from the grocery store, and its just terrible and I'm afraid its going to break each time. So glad I got to try this one. It really looks and feels like it will hold up through anything and will squeeze most of the juice out of any fruit you put in there. This squeezer works great for smaller/medium sized lemons and limes. You can get much more juice out of the lemons than hand squeezing.  If your lemons are too big, you can even cut them in quarters to fit and them use the squeezer. This squeezer is durable and very easy to use.	1
very useful tool it fits into everything and works with everything its amazing how one piece of metal can do you so much good!	1
I bought this for myself last Christmas and i didn't regret my purchase. This thing is soo light. I have a Gshock and that was light but this one trumps it. I saw this on the movie Battleship and wanted one ever since. This is a great conversation starter its got testosterone written all over it.	1
This shirt is gorgeous, however it is about a size and a half too small. So, just take that into consideration.	0
I am 5'8" and weigh 125 lbs. I usually wear a size 4 and ordered the Small. I tried it on and the top was loose (my bra size is 34DD)and the pants were so small, that if I had bent over, they would have ripped in half. I sent this back and ordered a size Medium which fit the exact same way with a looser top. I decided not to order the Large since our party was getting too close and I didn't have time to exchange. A size 4 unable to wear a Medium which is supposed to fit sizes 8-10?? It's a cute costume but fits poorly and is very poorly made. Bummed I cannot wear it to our Halloween party.	0
I have 3 dogs, enough said. All of them are technically short hair but one is a retriever mix so there is a golden glow to the house. Having used brushes in the past, I thought I just had to live with this. When I received the Hair Hero I was impressed by its design-- it felt so good in my hand. I started right in on the retriever and wow! I could not believe the pile of fur it produced. Thunder looked like a different dog and he was dancing around, coming back for more. (???) Seeing this, the other 2 lined up for their turn. I wasn't expecting much from their coats, but again, a surprising amount of fur. Another surprise, they were so shiny. So, needless to say I am totally sold on this product.	1
This was recommended by my hair stylist and I love it!  It holds my hair without any stickiness and gives it body, which I need for my thin hair.	0
These gloves are extremely thin,no way will it keep your hands warm, perhaps only good for use as liners and or used during early spring time.	0
Very easy to set up out of the box. This Vizio sound bar system brings out a good quality sound that is well balanced and powerful. I like the Bluetooth capability as I can play music from my phone or iPad without the use of an aux cable. I'm very pleased with my purchase.	1
That's great but I was almost abandoning this natural supplement. The first week when I started with this product, I didn't see any result. Only after two weeks i started to loose about 6-7 pounds/ week. Now, I've already ordered supplies for the next month.	1
Great product, clumps so amazing despite the lightness of the product which is also SUCH a bonus. Works so amazing for my five cats, best litter on the market hands down.	1
Used to be when I'd travel by plane, I'd bring a book, a stack of magazines, a large bottle of water and of course, I able to wear shoes with laces. Obviously, there's a new world order and traveling means I have to stay in touch with everyone at all times! Besides hauling my Mac Book, I now bring my iPhone, iPad, slide on shoes and because of TSA restrictions, no water bottle.<br /><br />I'm not phased by dehydration. Like most travelers, my fear of all fears, is that my electronics will lose their power, while in midair! I get the shakes at being left with no phone to tell my family, friends and colleagues that I'm waiting on a line or bored. I also shudder at having no books, magazines or emails from work to read. After all, without any power, I am a broken man - dehydrated, staring at my slip ons.<br /><br />I'd heard that external batteries were an option but thought they were expensive, bulky and not dependable. After hearing my son Alex rave about his battery pack, I decided to read some independent reviews and take a cyber stroll to Amazon. Review after review highlighted PBS's superb quality, reliability and features. However, my foremost reason for going with PBS was their excellent customer service. I noticed that if in fact there was a negative review, Anker remedied each and every malady. As a result of my research, I decided to order the PBS, PBS Smart 7000mAh External Battery Pack  for $35.99, at Amazon.	1
I have been in the Gym working really hard to lose my body fat. The tyre on my belly was just embarrassing and it felt like no matter how hard i tried, I could not lose it. After using these pills for a month, I had more energy during my workouts, I did not feel hungry all the time and i have already begun to lose a few waist sizes. I am very happy with this product.	1
My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />"So, tell me what it cant heal?" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.	1
a very useful glass i use every day in the kitchen. they are perfect for when you have some friends over and want to bring some cocktails or soda...	1
This 5 hour energy drink is something special. It really works for me and is a much better alternative to coffee, which I will not drink (saw my dad actually become addicted to coffee and then every time he would try to stop got incredibly awful withdrawal headaches). Personally, just taking a few sips of this thing can keep me going for a couple of hours straight, which means that the product lasts a long time.<br /><br />For those who would prefer a tea type of drink that gives a lot of energy, I have also recently tried this one (works great for me): [[ASIN:B00IDXDQ9I All Natural Organic - High Energy Caffeine Instant Black Tea Powder (Over 100 Servings Per Package) - Buy One Get One Free!]]. I like this because the energy kick that it provides is very smooth. It is strong, to be sure, and you will feel it almost right away, but it also tastes really good (which is a big advantage for all you 5-hr energy drinkers). The added caffeine is what makes this effective, so it might not be something you want to use every day, but for when a nice burst of continuous energy is needed, this comes in quite handy.	1
Nice product, comfortable, good sound quality. Easy to install. Great price for a fine headset. I would recommend these.	1
This cap is perfect and exactly what I ordered. It fits well and is a quality product. I will order another when this one wears out.	1
The main purpose of this dryer is to dry hair and it does a wonderful job in this regard. But this is valid as long it works. It didn't start after two-three months of using. Of course, I've had it replaced but I wasn't expecting a Revlon product to be disappoint me so quickly. The new product works fine.	1
I did quite a bit of research before buying this and decided to start using ketones to help lose extra weight. I have lost just shy of 9 pounds and have not gone on a diet or changed my regular routine which consists of a walk around the block every other day. I do think taking this product has helped accelerate my weight loss.	1
Works as expected.  This is an electrical multitool.  I use it for casual electrical work.  Strips and cuts wire with easy ... as it should.  Much better than my less expensive prior tool.	0
I don't get paid until I can find a person so I need practical and legal means to find a person with a way to verify. So many of the ways in this book are some I already use but I did learn a few new tricks and all of the online resources listed in here I'd never heard of before. I have more than 12 years experience as a small collection agency owner.	1
This did the job it needed to and had all the parts required for that. The instructions could've been a little better	1
The actual power supply is good, but the cable harness's had to be completely taken apart and re-oriented to avoid a birds nest of backwards wiring in tower. It's like they didn't test it to see if it works.	1
I haven't had a chance to try this mike out as of yet but my friends who I used to DJ with for an internet radio station have heard of these and some already have 1 and they like the YETI so we'll see here soon after we get resettled in our new home and I get back on air.	1
I really have a small hand so I ordered the Medium size, it was a tight fit to get them on, but once on I was able to wear them. Two wears and the seam is coming apart. I am not pleased at all.	1
This is a very nice watch from Casio's Edifice line. The light blue contrasting color looks great against the dark watch face. The watch has a nice solid weight to it, but not too heavy. I highly recommend this watch.	0
These were not sticky enough to stay on our stainless appliance.  Also, the band was not long enough to actually fit on the side of the oven and the front.  Returned.	0
The only complaint my dog has about this is that she can't get the little ball out!! Other than that, I'd say she is very happy with the toy!	0
Got this really fast in the mail. Has a nice smell and my legs feel smooth after. Make you feel like you are getting a spa treatment!	1
This is a great-looking compass, you just need a good chain to match it. It's not for kids though. I think there are some chemicals that might be dangerous for them.	1
I have used this for nearly a year, dropped it many times on the ground, still works great, my good assistant in office	1
This has quickly turned into my fave eyeglass cleaner. I have been going nuts with smudging my lenses and trying to keep them clean. The cloth is fantastic because it's extra large and plush.  Usually, cleaning cloths are much smaller, making it easy to accidentally get a finger onto what I'm trying to clean fingerprints off of.  And the solution itself wipes away fast and easy, with no streaks. And the fingerprint resistant properties really seem to work; minimizing smudges and prints so I have to clean my glasses less.  I do also use it on my tablet and phone, but mostly this is being used on my eyeglasses. Very happy with it thus far. Would buy again.	0
This brush is excellent.  I had a regular badger hair brush before and it was nice.  I still like it, but the feel of these silvertip badger hairs is leaps and bounds better.  You can't describe how much nicer it feels when you brush the lather on your face with this brush.  Well worth it.	0
Good tea for the money.  I love green tea.  I refuse to drink cheap or mediocre tea.  I drink this every day and like it.  This is not the same quality as what you would get at a Chinatown from Asian pharmacy loose leaf at $100 per pound, but it good for it's price.  Hence 4 stars.	0
I have bought every call of duty game since the first modern warfare.  Modern Warfare 3 put a bad taste in my mouth, this one did not bring any improvements in my mind.  Hopefully the franchise improves.	1
So first off, it is a lot darker than the picture, for us that was OK because we wanted something not that light, and by reading that review it was sold for us! The fact that it was so cheap, so big, and had non skid backing, we were sold. When it got here it was so much better in person! Beautiful, beautiful, it does feel a little cheap, but we don't care about that. After all it just goes under the dining room table to save our new floors. It's so perfect. 100%%% in love.	1
This is a daily routine in our house and this unit works very well.  We have to keep a daily chart for the doctor.	0
Table is solid and was easy to put together.  It does not wobble and looks very nice.  The wood is a very nice color.	0
I have really, really liked NHB's Garcinia.  I've taken the double dose for max weight loss, as suggested, and I feel fine and now after 3.5 weeks I'm having my friends notice the weight coming off.  100% of my good friends have said something.  By the way, the 3 month supply is the cheapest.	1
Sent David's to my Mom for Mother's Day.  She is 99 and lives in a retirement community.  She and everyone who shared in the gift, were amazed in the home made taste of these treats.  I am ordering some for myself!	0
I love it! I look more handsome wearing this watch... I will purchase more of their products. Thanks to Invicta...	0
Divine, delectable, amazing, tasty, yummy, my new brand for hot chocolate, incredibly delicious, scrumptious. Thank you Starbucks for creating an amazing cocoa!	1
No doubt someone tried to make an affordable pair of binoculars. These look good, feel good, but just don't perform. The image is small and dark, out of focus when zoomed in, and plagued by double vision.	1
Every time I got a headache, I drink two of this Advil liqui gels. 1 liqui gel is not enough for me.. It's very effective though.. Gonna buy 1 box.. I get a lot of headaches these days..	1
There is no better deal on an AC/DC pulse welder than this one and this one is an AHP!<br /><br />Mr Tig Wyatt Swaim and Kevin Caron reviewed this welder and both gave it a big thumbs up. You can see this welder and the arc in action here:<br /><br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdPKopzEgbY<br /><br />I have been very impressed by the welder's build quality and welding performance.<br />This is an excellent price for an AHP brand welder. It has pulse, start amps, end amps and post flow settings as well as AC balance. Excellent, excellent, excellent value.	1
This cable is an well made and high-quality alternative to the rip-offs that Monster sells.  It has all of the features specified by the latest HDMI standard.  This is by far the best HDMI cable I have found, especially for the price, and Mediabridge's other products are of similarly high quality and low price.  All in all, a great cable!	0
Bring back the union workers because this fruit pie was a total disappointment. What happened to the fruit pie of my youth? This pie had a glob of apple and sugar. The fruit pie in the 60's and 70's was dripping with fruit and had a crust was was thick and flaky, this was only thick. The only thing that was remotely the same was the sugary goodness.	0
I liked the characters for most part and had read the previous book in the series.  I think anyone who lives in a smaller town would relate to the individuals and probably enjoy the hint of romance in the book, too.	0

My package arrived faster than expected! Great service!!  This pole is not for super advanced pole tricks but it is perfect for having some fun and teasing your boyfriend. Make sure you secure it tightly and you shouldn't have any problems.	1
My hair was really thin and every since I've been taking this I've notice I straightened my hair for the first time for about a month of taking these pills I've noticed my hair got really thick and it's also gotten healthier and it has grown too.<br /><br />I will continue to take this. I really recommend this to whoever wants thicker and longer hair. It really worked out way better than just taking biotin for me!!	1
Amazon makes ordering so easy. shipping and delivery is also  fast.  This was a Xmas present for my best friend, she loved it and put it on her braclet right after she opened it. Thanks Amazon for making my shopping so easy without leaving my house.	0
Pros:<br />-The best looking G-Shock and digital watch I could find, period. Worth spending $130 (what I paid in 10.2011) just for the look. Looks bad-ass, manly, and heavy duty. You are no doubt to attract glances from everyone around you. I got compliments from women and friends who usually criticize my style.<br />-There is no unnecessary flash, so can wear at the gym or more formal occasions.<br />-This is a man's watch and makes every other G-Shock look either hideous or as a cheap toy. If Batman wore a watch, this would be it.<br />-The home screen is well utilized - every pixel has a purpose.<br />-Very light and fits comfortably. Not too big - just perfect. However, it's not comfortable to sleep with it on, so I take it off at night.<br />-Solar charging is a big plus. Battery lasts 9 months on full charge without any exposure to sunlight. No need to change or worry about the battery. Ever. It conserves light by shutting off the display at night, which turns back on the moment you pick it up in the morning.<br />-Stopwatch, timer, and five alarms with one snooze are very useful. I especially use the snooze option to remind me to take my medication at the same time each day. I do, however, wish there was a vibrate option (like the newer GD350, which was released Feb 2013).<br />-Can see (a pre-set) second timezone at the press of a button.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-No seconds adjustment in timer, only minutes. I need to set intervals for doing sets while working out, and I wish to be able to adjust the timer to the second (like 1min 30sec).<br />-Stopwatch is very elementary, whereas it has a lot more potential given the three-line display. Unlike the G7700 (which utilizes its 3-line displays perfectly), it only shows elapsed/split times (which even cheap digital watches do).<br />-Alarm is too quiet, I wish there was a volume adjust setting. I often miss it at the gym when timing my sets, and I don't even bother relying on it to wake me up.<br />-The light stays on too briefly, for about 1.5 sec. I wish I could adjust the duration of the backlight to set it to 2-3 seconds (the newer GD350 has 1, 3, and 5 second light options).<br />-Atomic timekeeping hard to get in SF area (Notice, the G9200 does not have atomic timekeeping).<br />-I never use the barometer (although the barometer display is cool to look at), thermometer, or altimeter (which is inaccurate, because its reading is based on the barometer). Thermometer is not reliable - off by up to 10 degrees Fa (have to take it off for at least 5 minutes to get accurate reading). Also, too much scrolling through the barometer, altimeter, and the altimeter-record functions (like 7 or 8 for full cycle).<br />-No compass... in case of a zombie apocalypse, you know.<br /><br />Overall, the best-looking digital watch you can find. However, I can do without the barometer and altimeter (and maybe even the atomic timing). I'd like it to have the option for a vibrator alarm and to be able to adjust the timer to the second.	1
I may advocate for avoiding refined sugar and processed foods, but cutting out sweet things in life can be too much. Using this coconut sugar, I can still enjoy that rush from the delicious taste without feeling guilty that it might impede my progress.	1
Just purchased this knife and really isn't bad for the price. However, the spring in the release is a little weak and doesn't extend the blade fully. Other than that I have no complaints. I use this for an everyday pocket knife and it works well for that.	1
Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.<br /><br />“Safe Haven” is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallström (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance “Dear John” a few years ago), “Safe Haven” is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.<br /><br />For “Safe Haven” attempts to be a “mystery” – in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie’s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.<br /><br />The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.	0
This product has many features and does everything that it has promised. I was having some troubles with my car battery and it dying. I didn't really know what to do about the problem and I wanted to have something in place just in case it would die. I used this when my car died and it was perfect! I can rest assured that this product will have my back no matter what happens to my car. I have also used this product as a phone charger. My phone dies a lot while I am driving and having this to charge it has really made that much more of a difference!	1
I will have to agree with the others, the quality on this unit isn't there.  I've had good luck with some other Black and Decker items but not this one.  Had the handle loose in the box, didn't even survive shipping...	1
Really nice for my bike and sound really good.<br />Suena super bien en mi bike, es comodo y confortable.	0
What a warm read..I loved the enthusiasm of caring for Lily<br />What a fun summer for a young boy..Crickets anyone !!	1
I combined this with an NO2 booster before workout and had energy to burn.  No problems sleeping, nasty burps, or anything else negative about this in terms of side effects.    By far the best test booster I have tried. I'm 44 yo and my recovery time is so quick lately I am increasing workouts to 6 days a week.	1
This was a perfect purchase because I was able to make 7 different bags for my 7 closest friends and relatives for Christmas. They all got different looks with different fabrics to fit their likes. Everyone loved their unique gift. They were super easy to make.	1
I received the free samples form the seller! Thank you! ! They are super comfortable mid lows! I love this color! I will upload some pics.  I been wear it all day long and it never hurts. Great! they are one of my favorite now! Fast shipping, and I am very impressed by the quality, detailed and lovely design. And it fit me perfect! I saw some buyer said that it run a bit small but if you can walk on it for a while it will fit you the way you want! The price is also lovely. Definitely add to my favorite store!	1
Thoroughly enjoyed this movie – it was great fun and the actresses are sooo beautiful! It was worth checking out for Kristina Klebe alone..! Out of all the creature feature horror movies – this is hands down one of the best I've seen yet. All it needed was more mermaids!	1
Very fast shipping<br />There is not a lot to say, the quality is very good so the only reason you should or shouldn't buy it is if you like what it says	0
This was a great Christmas gift for my son.  It is portable, and anyone can play!  We've played it in the different variations.  It is fun!	0
In love it. Bought it go with my PS4 and do not regret at all. Lowest input lag I've ever seen on a TV.	0
I think this hat is very adorable. It is great for playing dress up or having a photo booth at home or for parties. My head must be a little larger than most because it didn't cover my head the way the picture shows. It fit my children's heads just fine tho. It is fun to put it on while reading little red riding hood to the kids and changing up the voices. It's fun to add that kind of character to reading time!	1
Runs smaller than usual, even for Crocs.  Wasn't worth returning due to price.  Just not up to typical Croc standard.	0
This is a great repellant and it's non-toxic. I haven't see a rodent ever since I started using this!	1
for management of fibromyalgia pain but not recommended for internal use .it's hard to find ois that are  smells great	0
I love how my face feels after using this. I normally use a clay mask but I think I will continue using this one instead.	1
my kodak hero 4.2 does not recognize it and I can't print:  bummer!<br />I wisht they would have let me know that certain printers don't allow to print with this!	0
I could not for the life of me understand what so many people hated about this movie. I guess I'm just not that good of a thinker. On that note, I loved this movie and only have a few things about it that I take issue with.	1
received this last week. I have read a lot of reviews where people are saying they got different features but mine is just good and matches the product description. All the specs are just as they were described on the amazon sales page.	1
I bought two of them as I was moving therefore needed something big, these look fine, they are light and you can fold them, really big and can hold a lot but 1 of them broke after the first trip, more than breaking it came apart on one of the seams so maybe it was defective from the beginning, I don't know.	0
Sensei Freedman has an incredibly inspiring story of growing up on the streets of Boston. This book does a good job to capture his personality and wit, and delivers powerful insights about the martial arts and some things to consider for becoming an ever-improving martial artist. He has a very scientific method for delivering martial arts lessons, and is very open minded and forward thinking, but adheres to and honors the traditions of the arts he teaches. A short, easy read full of great info that will remain on my dojo bookshelf.	1
This creation is grand, I couldn't wait for the shipping time, so bought it with some additional cash for same day delivery, People are complaining it that it was made cheaply and all that s***ty things and I can't understand what's the matter with these people, this is really a masterpiece.	1
I really liked this movie but I do understand why some people did not like it. The first 20 minutes of the movie was unnecessary but that is just my opinion. Also, the griffons scene made it look like they could've just used that the whole time. Another thing that people might not have liked this is the fact that it only built up for the following movies.<br /><br />My suggestion for people who have not watched is to either watch it now and wait for the next movies or watch it when the next movie comes out. But for me, I suggest you guys just watch it especially if you are a LOTR fan.	1
These tea bags solve a lot of my problems. Drinking them makes me feel cleaner, healthier and overall, just a happy person!<br />They also make some really great ingredients for adding into some drinks that I like to make. The taste just reminds me of how healthy I'm living even if sometimes I feel like I'm not living healthy enough.<br /><br />I highly recommend them.	1
This shake is the best I have used!  It tastes so good and definitely serves as a safe &#34;bridge&#34; between lunch and supper.  The calories are good ones and the shake is delicious AND it has helped me lose weight and stick to the diet.  I use a small-size blender, skim or 1% lowfat milk, with 6 to 8 ice cubes, for a smooth and creamy shake.  This is an excellent product!  Highly recommended!!	0
I put these around the house like an easter egg hunt. Everytime someone goes for a cookie, looks for a mop, or uses the restroom, boom Mr. Beam is staring you down. Sometimes they go off when everyones sleeping. IF that happens it means you have ghosts in your house. Next halloween host the party!	1
It does everything it says it can do, works well with .mkv files (720p, 1080p), XBMC works great, I plugged in my own keyboard and mouse and it works. I would recommend this box to anyone.	1
My kiddo likes talking to the Octopus.  I like talking to the fat Whale.  We all talk and hang out and we babble and wobble and drool everywhere.  It's awesome.	0
My father owned the same tape measure his whole life. They aren't made like that anymore.<br /><br />I went through about one a year. The spring reload would bust or the metal tape would break.<br /><br />I got Stanley for a buck when the hardware store called them stocking stuffers.<br /><br />It has lasted four years now. A new record.<br /><br />It's not showing any sign of falling apart yet either.<br /><br />A good tape measure it is.	1
Brought back many childhood memories, good to keep.  Chipps Rafferty at his best as an Australian icon in the film industry in its early days.	0
Had to get it for my granddaughter &#34;Bianca&#34; since the mouse is called Miss Bianca. She loves it!!!!	0
Very premium made makeup brush. It uses materials that do not irritate the skin when applied, and it produces an attractive look, to anybody who uses it. I love this!	1
This came as a combo with game at the same price as the game alone. Great addition to my daughters collection.	1
It takes about 200 pumps to get a completely flat 26" x 2.1 tube to 45 pounds. It locks on to presta valves very easily and stays connected while pumping. It's not the best pump if you are in a hurry, but perfect for an emergency along the trail.	1
This seat has been awesome. Our house is on the market and we worried about potty seats all over the place. With this we have not had to worry about an eye sore at all. Our four year old can easy manipulate this seat and I love that I can take the entire thing off to clean... though I wish my husband would clean the toilets...!	0
These are good batteries, I like that they are rechargeable because I hate blowing money on new ones! They can get super expensive. These charged up quickly and worked in the items I used them in. I am not sure how long they will last, but I'll make notes and share more once they do die.	1
This is a great headset, But only down fall is that the game sound does NOT come through this headset, its just voice chat. If your wanting game sound come through also, this is NOT the headset for you. Works great and is comfy when playing the PS4	1
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS TABLE!!!!!! First off, people tried to discourage me from ordering a table and chair set offline, but when I saw this table and chairs, I fell in love with it....Plus, i wanted a bench option, to make it a 6 seater. For 236.00 bucks, I got EVERYTHING i was looking for!!!! I ordered it on a Monday, and recieved the table on that Friday, and the 4 chairs and the bench on Saturday. It was put together on Sunday, and it only took about an hour and a half. It had all the parts and tools to put it together included, so no searching around for stuff. I am so pleased with how it looks in my dining room! I highly recommend this table to anyone looking at it. Shop around on a price though, it is originally a 1,000 dollar table, some sites have it selling for that, some for 600, and some for 500!! I founf mine BRAND NEW for 236.00....VERY PLEASED WITH THIS PURCHASE!!!! :)	0
I bought this violin for myself, a beginner. The strings were terrible as was the case. I put on a set of Dominants and it had a great sound. I was impressed by the back of the violin, which was one solid piece of wood, not two. It is a very pretty violin to look at and listen to, however, there is a funny ring that comes from the E string which I just noticed.	1
If you truly want a top notch custom PC, you need to start from the ground up with high quality parts. If you buy this motherboard, you're on your way to a super fast computer.<br /><br />This motherboard has a few really solid aspects, like:<br /><br />Bunch of USB ports - 6 USB 2.0 with 3X the power on the back, then 2 USB 3.0 on the back. There are even slots for USB 3.0 on the front of your computer!<br />Ram, Ram, and more Ram - This Motherboard accepts upto 32GB of 2,000MHz Ram<br />Graphics Cards galore - This motherboard is made for Graphics Cards, so don't expect any integrated graphics over here. You can technically hook up three cards to this board, but I only suggest two since the last slot is on X8 and will slow down the rest of your cards.<br />Am3+ - Get ready for the future with AMD FX series processors!<br /><br />However, this motherboard does have a flaw or two:<br /><br />The last Graphics Card slot is only X8, which slows down the second graphics card and kind of making that slot useless.<br />This motherboard also requires A TON of power just to turn it over. I tried using my Thermaltake TR2-500Watt just to start out with, and it wouldn't do anything to this motherboard. Get atleast 600Watts with this motherboard, and with some intense graphics cards, I'd get closer to 1,000 Watts if I were you.<br /><br />Overall, I'm so happy that I bought this motherboard. You really need to have a good foundation to have an awesome PC, and this board gives you that :)	0
Sure you can get a chalkboard, create an entire chalkboard wall with chalkboard spray paint from Home Depot, spray the inside of your pantry to make a chalkboard...but the real fun may come in using these in gourmet and creative ways.<br /><br />I like to get slabs of slate or a similar stone with some grit at a garden or Hardware store, wash, and layout gourmet foods and appetizers when I entertain and use the chalk markers on them to identify each item.  These actually make a table look beautiful, especially if you can find ones that are not square cut (although those work great too).  This also makes a great hostess gift to skip the usual bottle of wine you bring as a gift, lay some cheeses out on a slate, and give them the pack of chalk markers.  People go wild over that one.<br /><br />Chalk is messy and dusty and unpleasant in so many ways--including breathing it.  Not so here.  No big nibs, no dust, no mess, no rubbing off--what you do is prime the marker by pressing the tip down until the chalk &#34;ink&#34; flows through.  Then start writing!<br /><br />When it's time to wipe off? A damp rag takes it all off--but it  does not rub off like regular chalk otherwise.<br /><br />It is far more easy to write with this.  And make it look good when you do it!<br /><br />It's nice to have lots of colors and be able to label the different names of cheeses etc. in different colors, or give each kid a color if you want to keep a wall planner calendar and label events for each person, another color for family events, another color for to do list etc.<br /><br />Great for kids to draw on because you can give them chalkboards, they can get colorful, wipe off and start again.<br /><br />Great to take a long board, spray paint it with chalkboard spray, have everyone write notes about what they love about a birthday person and have it run down the center of a table for a birthday party--nice for the photos and memories and for everyone to get to do and read.  Especially theguest of honor!<br /><br />Chalk provided by Chalk this Way	0
A stylish way to carry my clothes in while travelling. A great help since it accomodates more than one. Still using it up until now.	1
This game was perfect for the baby shower. It is colorful and has lots of good words to unscramble..The only downfall was that I had to go online to find the answers...You can do that by typing in &#34;unscramble words&#34; and it will take you to a site that shows you how to do it...Then you have the answers and it is a great game!	0
Smells great!  Works great too!  I'm somehow more charming and get lots of attention when I have it on....unbelievable!  I love the scent, it's very elegant.	0
I read another review of this watch indicating that there may be issues with the quality of the links. When I got the watch I took it over to our jeweler so that she could check that everything was okay. She found several screws in the band that were very loose. It was an easy fix, but still makes me nervous about the overall quality.	1
I bought this watch over 12 years ago and it is still on the original battery. Best watch I ever owned	1
Hehe. I have to admit that I loved this book. It was poor writing quality, as everybody says. Basically junk food in book form. But it was great! I couldn't put it down and frankly some of the scenes turned me on.	1
Keeping in mind my EDC folder is a Zero Tolerance 0300, the 4 star rating is based on the $18 and change I paid for this knife here on Amazon.  This knife is light, sharp, very comfortable in the hand, easy to find it if you drop it in the woods, has a nice sheath and as with all of the Bear Grylls products comes with the priorities of survival fold out. So for less than $20 you are getting a lot but for the $40 it cost at Cabellas I would leave it on the shelf. However for $18 if I lose or break it, no big loss. The knife is an excellent cutting tool but does not hold an edge extremely well due to the soft steel used in the BG knives (except for the Bear Grylls Ultimate Pro).  The soft steel does make re-sharpening a breeze though and this knife being half serrated there is always a usable cutting edge on this knife. There is a nice little pocketc inside the sheath for storing the Priorities of Survival fold out. The blade on this knife locks up very tight though I have not tested its strength nor will I. I don't put too much trust in the locks on my Benchmade, ZT's, SOG's, or Cold Steel knives. Locks can break and I can only assume the cheaper the knife is made the more prone it will be to break so I won't tempt my fate with this one by treating it like a fixed blade, I need all my fingers.  All in all it really is quite a nice sheath folder for fishing, day hiking, bug out bag or even a decent EDC knife for those on a tight budget.	0
My puppy likes this toy because of the crinkly sound it makes... and that's about it. I gave this 4/5 stars since it isn't his favorite chew toy.	0
When I finally understood the instructions to put the gate together, it went up and was in place in minutes. (I'm trying to keep my Bichon Frise puppy off of the carpet until she is potty trained.)  Was working in another room, and there she was beside me wanting to help.  I checked, and the gate was closed.  Found she is small enough to get between the bars - all hair and tiny body! Wrapped each section with plastic wrap.  She learned in a few hours how to remove the wrap.  Now the wrap is taped with packing tape.  A day later, it is still working fine!  The bars are too far apart for small puppies.	0
I had some reservations about using a shock collar, but after talking to an experienced trainer, he recommended one. I learned about why the technology is useful and that it's not damaging to the dog. It's like when you shock yourself after walking across the carpet. I took several descriptions to my trainer and we decide on Hot Spot. It's been very helpful. We were able to adjust the level of static shock and vibration as we went along, which was really helpful.	1
So easy to use and so inexpensive.  It's lightweight so you can use it even on soprano ukes and leave it there while you play.  Cannot be more simpler to use.  Hit the silver button and strum a string.  Couldn't be happier with my purchase.	0
I own this style in a more expensive pair. This one is good for the price. If the expensive ones were next to these, you could tell the difference, but on their own, in your ears, I think you'd get many compliments. They can be worn for evening or, with the present trends, you could wear them with jeans.,	1
I love how the legs of these fit.  The problem is that the waistband does not have nearly enough support.  There is no elastic in it and they slide right down.	0
I love these lights looks great i can see now better than ever thanks you guys came on time in great shape	0
Nice solid feel. Configurable. Tracks accurately. Really like this mouse except if you do a lot of movement it's very easy to click one of the side buttons. Overall great gaming mouse. However, I prefer the following instead<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BFOEY3Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00BFOEY3Y&linkCode=as2&tag=hocivfd-20&linkId=3XQNDA3KXBRPU4PH	1
None of their products work with any kind of urine. I try all their product. To my surprise none of them work. Waste of money. Only thing in Vinegar.	0
Not satisfied.<br /><br />I travel with my 4 monta baby boy and the  hammock was a waste of money  I didn't use it and the airplane have the crib service if you reserve with time. I am not happy with these product.	0
This recorder is just wonderful. It's easy to use. I can transfer the files easily to my computer. Hassle free.	1
This capo works as expected, it has good grip and brings the right tune of the guitar. Very nice product. :)	1
This replacement band seems identical to the original in quality and fit.  Of course, make sure it's the right one for your watch!<br /><br />I find it a bit easier to get the pins out (I use a small screwdriver) than to put them back in correctly, but with some patience and persistence it's something anyone can do.  I pull on the band to make sure that it's secure -- there have been times I think I have the pin all way in, but one side is not engaged in the hole and the whole thing comes out.	0
I was skeptic at first as this might also help unwanted visitors but after using it for a few days, I know how to prevent that. Brilliant piece of technology there, nicely done !	1
Searched all over for a large dutch oven. It's great for browning or carmalizing meat and with its large high grease does not splatter all over my stove. I also love it's ability to transfer it to the oven for roasting or braising. Great for soups. Easy cleanup.	1
Voltmeter - is really good, after final tuning, can work all most like a FLUKE, but ampermeter - DISASTER!!!!<br />readings are jumping +- 0.8 A every 1,5 - 2 sec.<br />Can not recommend	0
This is my second pair of Romikas.  I use them exclusively in the house, and they are perfect year-round, keep feet at comfortable temperature (we are in cold northern climate) and also help reduce fatigue.  They are extremely well-made.  My first pair lasted over 10 years, and I only got rid of them because they just looked old. (I did not take good care/cleaning, and had infants, now teenagers.)  The leather is easier to keep clean.  These are wonderful shoes, good German workmanship.  It took a while to receive them, but so very worth the wait.  I very highly recommend these shoes.	0
very nice and affordable chain. light weight.  True to size. I would recommend this product. I like they give you a bag to store it in.	0
I have been giving these FOREVER and new moms love the convenience and the fact that they know what their babies are eating. Just wish shipping costs weren't so high!	0
A great all around drill for $50 i must say! I have three cordless drills that are pretty cheap and was getting sick and tired of the batteries always dieing in the middle of my projects which is a pain in the rear and very frustrating....also a lot of money in batteries. I dont mind an extension cord because i'm usually working in one place at home so not a hassle there. My only problem with the drill is the vsr. It goes from 0 to 2500 rpm way too fast and there isnt much &#34;in between&#34; rpm. So be carefull when driving screws because its very easy to go too deep. I still like it though and would recommend to anyone that needs a good drill for a long time.	1
I just love this product , i always wanted to mirror what i was doing on my smartphone and computer on the tv but always thought that buying a product that will fulfill this need was going to cost me more than $100 ... Also , the design is just perfect !	1
If you are a Harry Potter fan, this is a very satisfying last chapter to the story that started so long ago. This movie follows the book quite closely, with a few exceptions. The main characters are good as always, there is a lot of action, a must have if you are a fan.	1
This is the filter I needed and had no other options for filters for this engine and so I guess that makes this filter the best. IIt's great for what its intended to do.	1
Great to store in the car. Never know when you need it. This light have different modes and throw a light beam at far distance. I'm a big fan of the company and their line of products.	0
Very, very nice jug for our lemonade or iced tea. It is attractive and fits in the refrigerator just fine. It was exactly what we needed and wanted.  I would recommend this jug for anyone who needs such an item. Right now ours is in the fridge just full of sweet tea.	0
VIolence in movies is overdone. After too much you become numb to it, and might have a fleeting appreciation of the plot structure as a silver lining.<br /><br />The camera work is intimate, and the characters act like a real family. There is true chemistry here, and it isn't obviously plotted like say, the typical Jennifer Aniston movie.<br /><br />And it is because of this intimate bonds that when the lows come, they pack a wallop. I have never seen such wretched emotion in a movie before. I have never seen such natural camaraderie. Incredible.	0
The design is nice. However I can't help pointing out the fragility of this bracelet. You have to be extremely careful, otherwise, you're gonna break it. I can't be worrying about it all the time while wearing it! Just doesn't work for me.	1
I purchased this item for my 7 year old grandson who was having difficulty following directions in school.  Being a Spiderman item, it captured and kept his attention.  The step by step directions are very well illustrated and he was able to construct the item with little supervision.  This item contains a fairly large amount of small pieces that require some thinking to assemble as depicted in the directions.  A great learning tool disguised basically as a game.	0
i recommend this it protect your screen i love it will buy more when i get the chance, it easy to put on as well.	0
This is another Movie that I can watch again and again. Centered around three guys that spend time in Vegas and getting into crazy drunken adventures.<br />If you didn't see it...Don't miss it.	1
These Teacup Cupcake molds are so cool and just perfect for any tea party! Having a  house full of girls at times we have many tea parties. Not just for the lil ladies but for the lil guys too! They all love to dress up in the fanciest clothing they can find. Got a tiara or extra jewels? why yes please! The more merrier! We love to play dress up and what better way than a tea party! Tea parties are wonderful you get to imagine, hang out with friends, and also learn your manners while enjoying fancy snacks and drinks.With these teacup cake molds you can have a party anytime! Not only do they look really cute they also work well! The silicone liner is not too soft and is just right for making cupcakes! I also liked how when you go to remove the liner it removes very easy. When making our muffins or cupcakes I like not having to use oil or butter. Even then with out the oil or butter the cupcakes didn't stick at all which was really nice to see there wasn't a mess to clean. I these and had plans for my sister's twins for Christmas as a gift sadly that didn't happen they came over walked into my bed room and started yelling OMGoodness!! OMGoodness!! These a the so<br />cute and insisted on using them right then! So that's what we did!<br />They really liked that they had lil plates to go with each teacup and enjoyed that they was just enough for them! These was enjoyed by everyone even me! They wasn't hard to clean at all.<br />I received one or more of the products mentioned above for free for my honest thoughts.	0
This chair is extremely comfortable. It is made of very soft materials that please the sitting. In addition, it is very cheap and very good quality. The truth totally recommend this product as people who spend much time on the computer gift.	1
I got the wallet as a gift, I really like the amount of pockets for credit cards and the clear plastic windows for ID.s.  This wallet is much better than the Tumi wallet I have been using.<br /><br />The RFID blocking is an added plus and I like my monogrammed initials on the wallet.	0
Works perfectly.  Slightly longer neck than my old ones but the color is warm white and it's hard to tell the difference from my regular bulbs.  Super fast shipping as well!	0
Super comfy, lightweight and breathable.  It also packs up very small  This carrier has the best variety of positions as well. For the price its the best one out on the market; and although it takes a few tries to get the hangout once you do it is fast and easy.	0
I was looking for a lightweight filtered flashlight for carrying in a pocket or small pack when backpacking or hunting and this is great.	0
I purchased these shoes for myself as a birthday present Spring of last year. Originally, I was thrilled with them. They arrived in a timely manner, fit good n looked nice. I was working two jobs then, so in all honesty..they were  almost never worn. I just noticed the other day when I decided to wear them that the burlap is splitting apart. That night I saw someone with the same shoes, so I started to compare. (Her shoes are authentic Toms). After comparing, I realized the ones I bought are knock-offs. I'm not going to say that every pair this seller has isn't authentic, but beware that you just may get that. I'm giving one star, because I value honesty. It isn't right that I paid full price for a pair of knock-offs.	0
My 10 yo daughter has used this half a dozen times and the stitching is coming apart.  Disappointed.	0
This damn thing does not fit the Brazilian made Corolla. It's too big so you'll have to cut it on the left and right side to make it fit.	0
Very nice watch .....i will tell people where i got it from....<br /><br />Thanks...alot...nice price and all...	0
I loved the uniqueness of this ring. I purchased this ring not only for its unique look, but also again for its reviews. Once again not disappointed. Thank you for making affordable quality gifts	1
Is it possible that the author meant to write  a CAPM book but by mistake marketed it as a PMP book?  Extremely misleading and full or errors. Questions are awful and have no similarity with real life questions. It is an ok book for the CAPM preparation though.	1
My son purchased this for his girlfriend, and I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  The peridot has nice color, and the bracelet (including the clasp) looks nicely made.	0
My friend ordered two of these and gave one to me because he just HAD to prove me wrong. I told him this was a gimmick and he said that it wasn't. Well, what do you know? It did absolutely nothing.<br /><br />I'm a pretty thin guy already and I avoid processed foods and sugar because I'm diabetic. I don't work out either, so nothing should have interfered with this product working. My abs stayed the same.	1
This product looks and functions exactly as its described.  It offers very nice quality, works perfectly for cufflinks and comes at a good price.	0
This is a cute little change purse it matches my makeup bag and purse but I will say it was not worth what I paid for it. here is why It is not that big it's thinner then the picture shows so you really can't hold that much change in it.	0
I've had this bag for a year, the really nice black faded to a normal black with a touch of grey at some edges  . The black metal paint has chipped a bit and it shows the metal underneath. The red insignia faded a bit as well. From someone whose bags are usually tearing apart from the seams or full of holes and just dirty by the end of the year. Well it saids alot about this bag that at the end of the year that it's still decent and I can wash the cotton hang it and have a clean bag by morning.  Not the prettiest or most comfortable bag what with the unpaded shoulder strap but it's perfect for someone looking for something durable and hard wearing.	0
This is my absolute favorite beanie. Its not hard to see why, I mean, just look at it. Its very attractive. My female friends say it looks handsome on me. I really love, love, love it.	1
I have been a fan of Christopher Moore for quite a while now, and have read nearly all of his books - and some of them more than once. He creates wonderful characters and injects them as well as the plot and dialogue with his great sense of humour. Sacre Bleu may not have been the funniest of all of his novels to date, but it certainly still made me laugh!<br />I was hooked from the very premise - I studied art history in college, and had a lot of fun seeing cameo appearances of all of my favorite Impressionist painters (and really, a co-starring role by some of them!). It was a really fun book, with a zany plot and terrific characters. I recommend saving it for the perfect "blue" day to brighten your mood!	0
I wanted a good sports watch without the expense of a great sports watch.  This is perfect for me.  Super easy-to-read large dial.  Light weight.  Dead accurate.  I haven't noticed the titanium scratching that others have mentioned and I'm tough on a watch.  I expect to abuse it for a good long time.  I have an older Citizen eco drive stainless watch purchased in the 90's and it just keeps on ticking.  And although the case and band are severely scratched and a little worn looking, the original crystal is perfectly clear.  I have had Seiko watches in the past and for me, they were two-year watches.	0
Please do not waste your money.  The product did not function properly and would not knit.  I have a broken hearted daughter and a return line in my future.	0
This is an instant hit!  Nice & clear speaking voice, and this looks like she came right out of Friendship Is Magic. Its very pretty, and we can't wait to get the Princess Celestia, they will look perfect side by side!	0
The tags are large and made very well - love the size and quality! Was so happy when I saw them- absolutely met my expectations and more!	0
You can see my story below on this unit. At this point I'm changing my review to come from a different perspective.    No product is perfect. That is why customer support is so important. Every product has some percentage of units that have issues. The better designed and made the product, the lower the percentage, but the percentage is never zero. I would have to believe from the reviews on Amazon, that the Trym II has very few units that have issues. I just happened to get one of them.    That's where customer support comes in. In our house, we recently had a flagship smartphone from a well know fruit company have a swollen battery. It wasn't a big deal, because we took it down to the local fruit store and promptly got a replacement. I don't hold the faulty phone against them - because it happens. No matter how great the design or manufacturing process. In fact, I continue to buy from them with confidence, because I know they stand behind their products.    The makers of Trym II have shown that they stand behind their product, too. And I have to say, that is much harder to do at this low price point than it is for the big fruit company. If you're considering this trimmer, I can whole heartedly recommend that you purchase it. The product works great and if by some extremely small chance your unit has issues - the company stands behind it's product.    ** UPDATE 8/22/2014 ** I have received a full replacement trimmer (including all attachments and accessories) by 2 day UPS delivery. Another win for Pure Enlightenment customer support.    ** UPDATE 8/21/2014 ** I have received a tracking number for a replacement unit that is to be delivered tomorrow.    ** UPDATE 8/20/2014 ** I was contacted by A to Zen support shortly after my review went live. I was asked to provide a mailing address and told a replacement unit would be sent. I'll update again when I hear anything further.    Purchased on Dec 17, 2013. Died on August 14, 2014.    I actually liked this trimmer a lotwhen it was working. But an 8 month life span isn't good enough. The trimmer does look nice, but don't mistake that for a quality build. The pictures make it look much nicer than it actually is. I think what this trimmer had going for it was the simple plastic "hair guides". A lot of the other trimmers have a single cage that adjusts and in my experience those just don't work very well.    I'm going back to using my monstrous Wahl hair clippers on my face. Not exactly an elegant solution, but my Wahl clippers are at least a decade old. And they still work. Imagine that.	0
I had purchased a different bag from this company almost a year ago. When I ordered this bag, I received an email telling me that my bag was coming, and if there were any problems, please contact them as they wanted a 5 star rating  if at all possible. I wrote back and truthfully told them that my first bag did have issues but that the issues were satisfactorily resolved and that I was hoping that there wouldn't be issues with this bag. They wrote back telling me that they had quality issues with a past supplier and had switched to a new one. I am very happy to say that this bag is very well constructed and worth considerably more than the price. Of course, the price is certainly one of the reason s to buy this bag. Just try to get a bag of this quality for this price anywhere! Can't be done. If you are considering a product from Annu Creations/Ecocraftworld  don't hesitate, buy with confidence. You will be pleased	0
I have been using Forcecut 80i 80 Amp Plasma cutter for quite some time now and I'm more than satisfied with this machine. It cuts thick metal sheets, even aluminium so easily. Even the prolonged usage hasn't damaged my machine a little bit. It runs as good as new, even today.  Thanks to this, I got rid of my bulky Oxy-fuel torch. This one's much simpler and effective than that. Any day better than the other stuff in the market. Simply cost effective and worth placing it in your garage. good!	1
i love the bars but the box i order from Amazon seemed a bit stale... the expiration date was good though. hope it was a rare instance.	0
Looking at the picture online I was a little hesitant to purchase this item. I was very happy when I received it. It looks so much better than I thought it would. It is the perfect album for my daughter's scrapbook!	1
Wow! Personally, I think this is one book that will be enjoyed by everyone no matter your age is. If you are an animal lover, it will be a perfect read for you. I love all the characters here especially Boris, Olga, Charlie and Gus. They are all very different from one another but that's what made this story more interesting. It has a lot of moral lessons to tell so, I think it'll be a really great read for kids. It shows how wonderful love is between humans and animals. Also, it gives the feeling of hope. No matter how tragic your life had become, it'll be change one day just like what happened to Boris and Olga. They both had a terrifying past but sooner or later, they found a loving family that gives them all the love and caring that they need and they are also able to experience lots of exciting adventures that they really enjoy. After reading this book, I feel more inspired to love animals more. It made me want to have a real life Boris, Olga, Charlie and Gus to take care of. It really is a great book. I highly recommend it.	1
Although it is really adorable and my daughter likes it the manufacturer should have considered that this walker needs to be picked up set up with one hand. Pick it up and it opens to the highest level never try to lower it with the baby in it.	1
After learning about the wonders of a ceramic flat iron, I thought all things must be better in ceramic and if the flat iron could do such wonders to my hair, lord only knew what a ceramic hair dryer might achieve. I have to say it is just a hair dryer. Nothing more, nothing less, and if it had only sold itself as such I would give it five stars. but by the description its ions and ceramic parts will turn your hair into a sleek mane of model hair. It is just a hair dryer.	1
The package is sealed , received in good condition, product effect and the seller description is consistent . Mirror high-end very atmosphere, suitable size , convenient inatallation , prevent dazzle eye design.	1
My cats love this.  I have to watch out to put it away and out of reach each time as they will find it and run off with it if I don't.  Hours of fund and great exercise for my little guys. Good packaging and quick shipping.	0
My daughter had been playing with various bead mazes, She loves them and I decided to buy one for her. This one is perfect because it has several tracks and mazes to follow, but is not a large as some of the other ones. It is well built and is surviving very well. She has a great time playing with it	1
This watch is definitely a head turner. Everywhere my boyfriend goes, people stop his and ask him where he got it and how much! It looks pricey, he wears it almost daily. We recently ordered a second one in a different color and a few for the boys on our Christmas list!	0
I have been through 2 units that do not even accept a charge, right out of the box, so far.<br />Yes, I know that the unit has to be powered on in order to charge.  Charger works for one battery but not the other.<br />One (1) of the first ones delivered is working good though.  Using to power 12V LED accessory lights.<br />The original 2 units delivered had a small led protruding through the plastic case and no &#34;USB&#34; charger port that is not a feature.<br />2nd one Battery lights up when charging but does not hold a charge.  Caution: battery light is powered on when plugged in regardless of whether the power switch is on or off.<br />The 1st replaced one was a different design that had the indicator light built into the power switch.<br />Now the item is under review by Amazon and I'm being told that they are investigating.  Maybe they have been stored too long or in a non-temp controlled warehouse in Vegas - where my batteries have shipped from.	0
Settled on these so far after 10 years of playing. They will break after a while at .45 thickness and heavy play.	0
Nice case for Samsung Intensity 2.  I originally bought the blue plastic case at the Verizon store when I bought the phone for my daugther.  It cracked within 2 months.  This case is a much better case at 1/2 the price.  I would recommend it.	0
I was so very delightfully surprised at the quality and beauty of these earrings. They come so beautifully package each earring separated so as not to get tangled in shipment. I am buying more of this brand. I just LOVE them.	1
As other reviewers have mentioned, the packaging for this product virtually ensures the discs will arrive damaged. Sure enough, on the first disc I put in two of the four episodes will not play. It's not available for replacement (although I don't know that I want another of these), so sending it back for a refund is my only option. Not a good customer experience here.	0
My son uses the light to read at night in his top bunk bed. At first it was a little stiff, but he's gotten the hang of placing the light just where he wants it. It gives off good focused light and is easy to turn off and on.	1
Will work quite well for taking a single dose with me- and have a place to keep the used syringe until I get home to throw it in my sharps container.  Inexpensive, but effective.	0
For $15 this is absolutely amazing. Especially the quality at night shocked me the picture I uploaded was taken in complete darkness, customer photo Volvo s70.<br /><br />Only problem was it was to wide and covered my tags, easy enough to fix just sawed off the ends now fits perfect.<br /><br />The picture is amazing in daylight and nighttime, nice guide overlay, and easy to install. Anyone wondering, I just cut the cord ran it threw a hole I made in my license plate light, sealed around the cord, once the wire is cut there's 3 more wires inside power, video, ground just reconnect the wires by color. Hooked power to the reverse lights and ran cords to my double din. Easy as that. Will update if I have any problems but so far its been freezing and snowy and rain and have not had a problem with it.<br /><br />Just a tip if water gets on the glass it may distort the picture a bit, just rub some rainx or wax on and it beads off nicely.<br /><br />Will update if anything happens, but really for $15 can't ask for more, let's just see if it will last.<br /><br />----------EDIT-----------<br /><br />Have been using this for about a year now and have not had any problems with it.  Picture is still very clear.  I have hand washed and used laser car washes and never had water leak into the camera.<br /><br />I would still recommend this to anyone that wants a easy to install back up camera.	0
It was a great deal. I needed them due to this inclement weather. I recommend it. installation was easy and the quality is awsome	0
Love the bag, beautiful saddle color, great for an overnight trip. The price was good compared to other bags I checked out. I gave it to my husband for a gift. However, I know I will be using it as well.	1
the black is very faded and noticeable. Its very soft and comfy but i wish the black was a little stronger and didnt look as cheap.	0
OK my cat loved them.  But she didn't CHEW them.  Not sure how they will clean her teath when they are so small. When I see Greenies I think dental chew.  Just too small.  We finished the bag and have returned to buying the &#34;pure bites&#34;. At least these take some effort to eat and they are ONE ingredient.	0
Love this book.  Perfect for a wide variety of ages.  It's simple and high level & uses terminology children today are familiar with.  My children enjoyed this book very much, as did I.  Great job Jennifer, can we expect a more in-depth book on this subject in the future?  :-)	0
We all have been there. Our baby pets suddenly start being a little more loud than we like. I live in an apartment complex and having a pet means constantly keeping my Scottie under leash and keep him as quiet as possible. All was going well until a few months back when he started this weird fantasy of barking at any and everything that moves. And that means a constant source of noise the ENTIRE day! At first I thought it was a phase and would soon go away, but even after a few weeks, it kept going on. One of my neighbors in the complex suggested me this collar after having successfully used it on her dog. I waited a few more days but when it got unbearable, I had to order it.<br />It's been 2 weeks now since I have been using this on Scottie. And believe me when I say this, my home is much more peaceful now! Even without the collar, he doesn't bark as much. I think he is trained now! I am gradually going to stop using the collar if he keeps up with this!	1
This is a very nice little tablet for the price. The tablet arrived nicely packaged with a charger, USB cable and USB keyboard adapter cable. Also included was a nice instruction booklet. Awesome video streaming with an excellent screen resolution. It's perfect for me. I love it	1
Just exactly what I was searching for. My buddy gave this to me on thanksgiving and its perfect. Great design and quality!	1
This is the first toy iv ever bought, and let me just say.. I am sooo so soooo happy that I did this. This thing is amazing. The vibration is quiet. its perfect.	1
At first I bought this as a novelty, and found no real reason to use it, but when I disconnected my seats for periodic cleaning, I found a phone. I don't know who owns it, it's an old samsung, and it doesn't work anymore after charging. I guess I needed it after all.	1
It did what I needed it to. I lost my last lens cap, so needed to replace it. This was the right size for my camera.	0
Not at all the computer I wanted. It preforms really slowly and the convertible function is not user friendly. I am very let down and plan to get a different computer soon.	1
I've used plenty of yellow (and other colors) legal pads because they're handy, standard sized, and available.<br /><br />There is nothing particularly special about these legal pads, they're certainly more than adequate.<br /><br />The paper has wide lines, which I prefer, because it's easier to write on.  And the individual sheets of paper tear across the top with perforations, rather than a &#34;gummed&#34; top.<br /><br />This paper is thick enough so that I can use my large-tipped roller ball pens on it without the ink &#34;soaking through&#34; the paper to the other side of the paper.<br /><br />And, amazon sent the paper right to my front door, which is certainly a convenience, saving me having to go out and buy the pads of paper at the same or even higher price.	0
Getting this TV for my bedroom, I figured it would work out just great even though it was such a good deal for just over $200...<br /><br />The first thing I noticed was the stand and it's strength compared to the weight of the TV. I could hardly believe that it was able to support the TV for any length of time being so flimsy and wobbly.<br /><br />The picture was actually worse than the 5 year old TV I was replacing, I just couldn't believe that was even possible!<br /><br />The last thing that had me decide to try a different TV was the HDMI port having an issue where the picture was fuzzy and I had to jiggle the cord to get it to go normal, even with multiple cords.<br /><br />I ended up returning the TV and getting one I have never been happier with! It's been almost two months and I have yet to have an issue.<br /><br />I bought it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qcVVnZ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the TV for you, at least you have a heads up about this one!	1
Sir, this DVD is not a Hollywood Production I understand and appreciate your feedback. However, I believe the content itself to be extremely valuable for the beginner. I assure you the video was not transferred from a VHS. The audio is fine, it was recorded inside my Greenhouse and I could not eliminate some of the background noise due to Greenhouse equipment operating but had never had anyone indicate the audio was unsatisfactory.	1
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yuVFRIlzOh8<br /><br />Check out this great and bright and very well built set	1
Gorgeous pendant!  I'm looking forward to wearing it this weekend when I go to church.  I ordered a second one for a friend's Christmas present.	1
I really like this metal display stand for my purses, now I can see them and pick out what I want to use, where before they were in my closet and I would forget about some of them, very pleased.	0
True Junk - the spreader mechanism corroded in three short years to the point of becoming non-functional. It had become completely frozen, despite light use.<br /><br />History: I purchased this spreader at a local Home Depot. I used it twice a year to spread fertilizer/lime on a small lawn. I stored it (empty) in my garage between uses. Within three years (about six to eight uses) the metal drive shaft (that spins the propeller) had corroded so badly in its bearing that it could not be freed with oils, solvents, etc. Even an air racket would not free it!<br /><br />I thought I was buying a professional spreader that would last a lifetime but rather I had bought an expensive piece of junk.<br /><br />One last failure: While the spreader was already junk, I put the spreader away in the garage - postponing throwing it out. Come spring cleanup this year - I pulled it out of the garage for trash pickup and noticed the plastic hopper have developed stress cracks and a hole. That is how poorly manufactured the plastic is. And these flaws appeared while the spreader was empty, in storage, in a well ventilated garage!<br /><br />I can honestly state this is the worse piece of equipment I've ever purchased in the last twenty years. If Agri-Fab were willing to ship me a new one of these, each and every year, for life -- I'd pay the asking price. Otherwise - I'd look elsewhere.<br /><br />(BTW: During its short lifetime; it worked extremely well)<br /><br />Free advice to Agri-Fab: Upgrade your drive/propeller shaft to stainless steel and improve the grade of plastic you use in the hopper. Then, you'd have a true winner - everything else is well made. Also - as noted - when it worked - it spread perfectly and with ease. It is a shame these design flaws exist because when it worked, this spreader worked flawlessly.<br /><br />If this review seems contradictory - it is. What you have is a near perfect spreader that suffers from a few cheap components that severely limited its lifespan.	0
This is my first day with it.<br />I found that if have Mac Mini 2011 withYosemite and a Windows 7 laptop connected and running at same time, it has trouble switching back to Mac (display stays black).<br /><br />Dunno if would fix itself if I left it long enough, but I needed to reboot Mac Mini to get picture back.<br />However when swiping again, the same issue occurs when swapping back<br /><br />When PC is turned off, it also seems to recover the Mac display<br />So may it seems if have both on at same time, there could be some sort of conflict and may need to unplug display or power down PC laptop to recover.<br /><br />So what I plan to try next is when Mac display won't come back, unplug PC from other cable, and failing that power off PC<br /><br />I don't really blame the product, it is probably that the 2 systems are using slightly different screen modes that confused the 27&#34; Cinema display (much like HDMI switches require displays to use exact same resolution etc)	0
The quality of the frames is very good. I love these frames and I wish I could find them in other colors.	1
Super cute for my yard, I'm a huge fan of solar lights. I love the color blue, it lights up my whole yard, and I have sat outside with it completely pitch black, it's beautiful. The blue and yellow go great together, I have both in my yard currently. The solar lights last a long period of time, and don't burn out easily. My favorite mode is when it blinks the colors.	1
I need to change the batteries in watches that have the pressed on covers. I was unable to lift the covers off 2 watches that need batteries changed. I'm sure this kit will work for twist-off covers, but that does nothing for me. I have no use for this kit since all my watches have pressed on covers.	0
It seems the netting on pool skimmers last only about 2 years and then dry rot. I am hoping this lasts longer but we shall see. It ius a little narrower then my old skimmer and fits very snugly on the pole but works just fine. It has a steel reinforcement around the plastic border so that part should hold up fine. The price was good and it was delivered fairly quickly.	0
This desk is pretty fricken sweet. My only complaint is that I didn't get it in two days even though it had &#34;prime&#34; available, so I wasn't able to enjoy the desk for Spring Break. Now let's get to it!<br />Pros:<br />Assembly: Easy to follow and doesn't take more than an hour or so, depending on if you have help.<br />GLASS. I was half-expecting transparent glass, and then when I saw the tempered glass I was in awe.<br />Sturdy: The desk didn't seem all that sturdy at first but after putting it together it is pretty sturdy.<br />CPU stand: great plus, my tower fit perfectly on it,but I have carpeting, so I opterd to put a wooden plank under it so that the tower still gets the air circulation it needs.<br />Space: the amount of space that becomes available with this desk is phenomenal. I have three monitors but only really use two simultaneously at a time, the placing is just one on the left, center, and right, not at all shabby since the focus is usually on one anyway.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Can't say I have any except for the not so Prime delivery, but the wait was totally worth it.	0
I'm an adult and bought this hoping to wear it high on my true waist, which is 25&#34;. I got a size 14, which the chart here says should be 26.5&#34;. The chart on FrenchToast.com says a 14 has a relaxed waist size of 27&#34; and a stretched size of 29.5&#34;. The skirt is actually 29&#34;. It's way too big. I'm sending it back and getting a refund, but I'd like to get one that fits me, and don't know which one to get because the charts are both confusing.<br /><br />It's also NOT pleated in the back, which isn't shown or described here, only on their website, which I read after purchasing.	0
My daughter loves playing, even if she doesn't quite grasp taking turns and how the pieces move.  Good family fun!	0
- audio is atrocious, however you can connect it (via an lightning-HDMI adapter) to an iPhone/iPad that has its audio delegated via bluetooth to an external, wireless speaker. - Resolution is good, however not excellent. - Battery life is much too short, not enough for watching even a typical 2-hour movie. - On the bright side: product is very compact, has an aesthetic design and well crafted.	0
I purchased the clear case and received it today (my note edge arrived yesterday :) ).  The case fits fairly well except at the bottom where it seems to hang down (sags) below the edge of the phone (it's not loose and floppy, it just does not cover the phone correctly).  It is not really that noticeable visually except that the bottom center edge of the phone is exposed should I drop it.  The buttons are all usable, I can easily plug in my cord and headphones and the all important &#34;edge&#34; of the phone is completely accessible.	0
Girlfriend loved them. Seemed very fragile yet looked beautiful on her. She thinks they are beautiful and in the end that's all that matters	0
Got this for a guy who loves Scooby. It was the perfect gift for someone I had no clue what to buy for.	0
Watch is gorgeous, but has no way to make wristband bigger so if you have big wrists or don't like your watch tight you can't adjust it. Also it needs black hands so it's easier to read.	1
They are fantastic in looks and great in protection, even spider can't touch you if you wear it, and I hate spiders that have already bitten me several times so I got it to get rid from them.	1
Given its modest price, purchased this just to determine whether it could hold camera/binoculars more securely when trekking over difficult terrain (most recently, Patagonia) than using a standard strap (a heretofore favorite being the Op/Tec version long enough to allow the camera to swing on one side). The harness won out every day and was MUCH easier on shoulders and, even with elastic straps, minimized movement and resultant need to compensate when navigating uneven ground. Speaking of elastic, my camera, a relatively heavy Nikon D300 plus 18-300 lens (the heavier version) did cause significant stretching, but adjusting the straps compensated fully and still allowed full range of motion from chest to eye level. Best of all, even after a long day, I had forgotten just how heavy the camera/lens really really was. Finally, the Op/Tech connector system allows one to mix and match various devices for ease of handling and safety.<br />Cannot recommend highly enough.	0
These were my daughter’s idea and boy was the expression on her face when the balls just deflated fierce. Needless to say, I will be doing my shopping from now on.	1
This is a fine piece of leather that will last for years.  The quality is the true essence of fine Italian leather.  The color is true to the image displayed online.  And it shipped fast!  I will definitely purchase other products from Floto Imports.	0
Very good value phone. The phone itself I'd give 3 stars when compared to S4 or S5 on specs, but those costs 3X as much.  Is this phone only a 1/3 of what those phones are?  NOPE.  On value I give 5 stars, so 4 stars overall.  Truth is, I bought this for my daughter's first phone and it's perfect for that.  I've played around with it quite a bit and it can handle any App we've thrown at it.  The screen is slightly smaller than a S4 or S3 and it's not as vivid, but you really don't notice unless you're running them side by side.  Camera is not super awesome, but is perfectly fine for a teenager or any casual user that's not expecting professional results from a phone camera.<br /><br />The quad core processor is very capable and doesn't get bogged down like other budget Androids.  Well worth the price. Best budget Android available in my opinion.	0
As an intermediate guitar player (15 years), I ordered this dvd as a complement of the tab book (playalong series) that i already bought before. Actually, it is just a performance , having Doug Boduch as the guitar player (excellent, by the way), with tabs underneath, and 3 different camera angles to choose from. Don't expect any &#34; put your pinky on the 4th fret, second string&#34; kind of stuff!!!, or any slow motion  playing...there is NONE of that!!!!. NO EXPLANATION whatsoever... just a performance with a very small introduction in the beguinning. I liked it..the playing is flawless, the sound: spot on....but not for  beguinners...I also own the SAntana, and Clapton dvd's...they are all lie in the same category....excellent as a complement, but don't expect any explanation or a tutorial...look somewhere else for that.	0
Pleasantly surprised by the ease of installation. Syncing to our directtv remote was quick and easy. Sounds amazing, noticed an immediate difference between this and another sound bar. Only cons are there is no back light on the remote and unfortunately the small speakers aren't wireless.	0
My brother got me this for Christmas and it's a whole lot of fun. It looks just like the real thing, makes authentic noises and rather satisfyingly springs open (even though weirdly you have to push a button on the bottom to open it when it's in the open position, and not the normal button).<br />Still, I had a great time chasing the dog around with it and trying to command visitors to shut up. Yes, it's a fun toy. Oh, by the way, I'm 48 years old which says more about me than it does this product :-)<br /><br />P.S. It was unable to unlock any doors in my house. Should I return it?	0
Had four DirecTV devices, needed to expand to five, this worked right out of the box with no issues whatsoever.	1
My dog has hip joint issues and this has really helped him be more mobile. If I run out of this, he immediately becomes less mobile.	1
Everything you could possibly want from a DSLR camera. All of the individual components seem to be at the very least good quality, some of them great. It's very resistant, too. I am using it for quite a while and it still looks like new.	1
We moved to colder climates last year so sandwich and chips just wasn't enough for our kids on cold days.<br /><br />We wanted to get a thermos that looked nice, encourages the kids to bring it back home, and was functional at the same time. So we picked these up because we could get different colors for each of the kids.<br /><br />Now my husband will make them some hot soup at about 7:30 in the morning and by lunch time at 12:30 the kids have said everything is still hot. The other nice thing is they say all there friends comment them on their thermos.	1
There are plenty of mustaches and sunglasses which is perfect for my silly twins. We got lots of great photos. These are pretty sturdy! It was good quality and all the items are still intact the next day. I would definitely recommend this set for your next party or get together.	1
Good quality finger puppet and good for the kids. The texture is comfortable and each puppet is pretty awesome. The size is perfect. Nothing compares to niceEshop! Great product guys!	1
Got this Garcinia cambogia for two months as prescribed. There was no positive effect of any kind.<br />Wasted period along with cash. They assure a good deal but fail to deliver very poorly	1
I have used various types of wash mitts over these years, but all of them felt a bit slippery inside after some time and became harder to hold with my hands. After reading number of reviews on amazon, I decided to purchase wash mitts from Crusar due to their good elastic wrists and pretty good size. I was really impressed with their shipping timings and nice packaging. These wash mitts are perfectly fit for my hands. These microfiber mitten has longer fibre fingers and therefore has more ability to absorb waters.  These mitts are also great for other purposes like dusting of delicate objects, electronics and even soaking wet dogs after a bath. Overall, the products are very good so far and worth caring for. I would surely like to recommend for all washing and drying purpose.	1
this is complete garbage it says its rubber i think they meant rubbish i think its made of plastic beside the fact it stinks worse then a skunk and its not at all heavy duty Beware the color will fade after a short amount of time	1
Works with my 11 inch Macbook Air! I was concerned since I have only two USB ports and each on opposite sides of my laptop, but I only plugged in one USB and it works just fine. I love that it doesn't have to plugged in to an outlet.  Just plug into your laptop and start burning.  I didn't need to set up nothing, no installation disk, NOTHING.  I absolutely love it. Its sleek, slim, light-weight and works like a dream....just like my Air =))  Cheap too!!...unlike my Air! LOL	0
Great sound bar! I use it for everything, from watching TV to playing music while entertaining guests. The subwoofer isn't very powerful (and I barely notice the bass now) but the overall sound is great. The wireless subwoofer is easy to hide in a corner or behind a side table. The only 2 features I which this unit had is 1) A bluetooth connection to play music 2) A way to set the subwoofer volume.<br />The installation is very easy! i have mine mounted on the wall below the TV. It is very sleek and looks great.	0
We got burgled last year, they backed a truck up to my workshop and walked out with $3000 worth of tools..<br /><br />Really made me angry. so I installed a video surveillance cameras.  The problem with those is that you have to know that you've been robbed in order to find that short piece of video to review.<br /><br />Dropcam, makes this much easier.  It notifies you when there's activity.<br /><br />the cops loved the video I got off dropcam of two young men trying to break in..  When the "guy in the hat" see's the dropcam, they take off running..<br /><br />It works, it's easy to install.  I can watch the video's on my phone or Ipad..<br /><br />love it..	0
I want to get them in every freakin color.  I ordered them originally in my size but they were too tight.  One size bigger and they were perfect.  Matched my outfit perfect.  Comfortable and I danced all night in them.	0
I love my Bose!!!!!!!  I had to get an antenna from Amazon, which was an Terk am antenna.  Works great!	0
I am writing this review for my wife because she is too nice. I'm nice too, just not happy.<br /><br />We've had a Paderno spiral slicer since 2012 and get great use out of it.<br />Last week we decided to buy a 2nd spiral slicer for the cabin since we are spending more time up there these days. I told my wife to buy this one because of the good reviews, especially the one from top reviewer RWM.<br />We got it and took our usual bunch of vegetables up and besides the softest ones, the Briefton was not capable enough. Just too flimsy and blades not sharp enough. Ruined our dinner and wife blamed me for choosing it of course.<br /><br />We are returning it but it really should have NEVER been ranked equal or higher than the Paderno!<br /><br />Hope his helps others from wasting their time.	1
I was recently introduced to Lady Grey tea - which is so much better than the tea named after her husband, the Earl of Grey.  I was therefore, quite pleased to see that Amazon carries both regular and decaf.  The perfect drink for a Midwestern winter afternoon.	0
I am a frustrated magician and I bought this set to teach my 6-year old son and 9-year old daughter some tricks. I am very happy that the set contains most of the common magic tricks we all know as a child and they were very easy to master. The stuff inside are very good quality...almost like professional grade....and there were too many in the set! I am absolutely happy with the purchase. I would glady buy again once Melissa & Doug come out with a new edition.	1
This was the worse product and such a waste of money. The blower did not work and it got so hot, I was afraid it was going to catch on fire. It had a burning smell as well	0
This is perfect for separating our family room from the formal dining room. We use it to keep both baby and dogs corralled. Installation was a pain, but now that it is up no complaints.	0
This Procella 62 inch golf umbrella is a great value. My gold standard umbrella is a 68 inch Gustbuster Titleist branded umbrella. The Procella stacks up well in comparison, and is less expensive.<br /><br />The Procella umbrella has some great features - the handle is rubberized beefy, with a golf grip style pattern. With one button press the umbrella shoots open - a super nice feature when it starts raining and you want to get under the umbrella quickly. This is a double canopy umbrella, meaning the top two thirds of the umbrella are covered with a second layer. That second layer is vented to the main canopy. Inside the umbrella mesh covers the opening between the two layers - this is super nice because it improves the strength of the fabric.<br /><br />Those are features the Procella has that are better than the Gustbuster. The Procella weighs a half pound less than the Gustbuster (1 pound 8 ounces to 2 pounds). I guess you could get an extra beer in your golf bag for the weight savings - advantage Procella. Both have similar sewing and cloth for the canopy - neither is perfection. They are both pretty close to the same length (the Gustbuster is about 6 inches longer, but that's really negligible), and are the same diameter when wrapped up closed (they both fit in a standard golf bag umbrella holder). The Gustbuster is a bigger umbrella (well you knew that, 62 inches versus 68), the difference is actually more significant than you might imagine. You will probably never get wet underneath either umbrella, but that extra six inch diameter and deeper dome might come in handy. Slight advantage Gustbuster. They both have sturdy spines or skeleton. The Gustbuster went with a single spar and used a thicker material. Procella went with smaller spars and a second support rod. Don't think one is really that much better than the other - they will both work.<br /><br />The Gustbuster has two big differences. The first one is price; it is a lot more expensive. When I wrote this review the Procella is selling for $35 and I paid $65 for the Titleist umbrella. Gustbusters can be purchased without a brand on them for around $50. Huge advantage for Procella.<br /><br />The second big difference is the upper canopy, and this may or may not be worth all the extra money. Gustbuster added elastic hold down strips to the upper canopy. If there is a really strong wind, the upper canopy can actually lift away from the umbrella allowing more air to flow through the umbrella. That little tiny difference could be the difference between the umbrella flying away and keeping ahold of it. I'm not sure how frequently that would come into play - it might be so nasty out at that stage, you should be in the clubhouse anyway (or have on rain gear).<br /><br />The Procella I was sent for testing is a blue and white umbrella. I like the look a lot, the blue is a nice deep royal blue and the company name and logo is printed in black on a white section. The umbrella looks handsome - my wife said she wouldn't hesitate to grab this umbrella; she would leave the Titleist behind - too much golf logo for her taste.<br /><br />Oh it is a onetime thing; the box the umbrella came in is really pretty. This arrived in the middle of winter and the picture around the box is a beautiful blue sky with a perfectly placed golf ball on some fairway grass. Yes, that's what dreams are made of.<br /><br />The Procella golf umbrella is a great reasonably priced alternative to more expensive umbrellas. And because it is that much lighter than the others, you can get an extra beverage in your bag for the same weight.	0
I really like this screwdriver. Its very small but it also is top notch quality. I wasnt sure what to expect at this price but I was very impressed. I would recommend this to anyone	1
Mine are way darker then the picture shown closer to an amethyst color then the red/pink/plum color pictured. Not pleased	0
We bought this for my father for Christmas 2012, at first it was great!  Then it just kept getting  worse... At first the outside sensor went, we live in Maine and have some harsh weather but we got this because it was supposed to be up to the test. Then the clock kept messing up, then the screen would die.  Now it's just never working.  I don't know if this is just ours or if it's only supposed to be good for a year. A little disappointing.	0
I like the saw now that I modified it. When I first started using the saw I noticed there was not enough water getting on the blade. The way the water gets to the blade is nothing like I had ever seen. There are two tubes that come down on each side of the blade that you can adjust to hit the blade. The issue I found was in the 90 degree fitting where the water tube attached. I removed the fitting and used a drill bit to make the opening going through the fitting larger. I'm not sure if this was a design issue or if the plastic fitting when it was molded did not leave a big enough orfus. After the minor modification I like the saws performance.	0
It is a little bigger than I thought it would be but the chain is longer so it looks nice.  I also ordered the earrings that match but they have not arrived yet.	0
This is a very cost effective yet fully featured way to make a spare 2.5&#34; HDD or SSD an external hard drive. It comes with a nice leather-ish protection bag, the USB cord, attractive packaging, all for about 13 bucks. Can't beat that!	0
The picture and pricing is very deceiving i would not recommend. It look like you can buy this at a dollar store instead i would not have waste my money on it. Really list price at $99 so not worth it.	1
When you come across a jump starter, you don't expect a whole lot of extra features like a strobe light, built-in micro USB cable etc. This one really surprised me.	1
These were used as part of the edible decorations at my baby shower. You should have seen us like big babies.	1
I really enjoy the scent of this Rosemary oil. It isn't super strong but it does the job. I keep it around for late nights and early mornings. Perks me right up so I can get through.	1
This is OK TV, my 5 year old just like it for a while, not too fun, video quality is so so, I don't recommend it...	1
This bag was a gift to my honey, he love it so much.The canvas seems like it will last a long time. I compared it to canvas on other favorite bags that I have used for years and it looks similar.The canvas is rugged and slightly water resistant.About the size is perfect for daily use, shopping, dating, office,oh may be also great for student.Incertainly recommend its purchase for anyone who's looking for a good and affordable messenger bag.	1
The description when purchasing did not do this product justice.  It is sturdy and tall.  This product is used in a business with tall shelving and tall doorways.  It is excellent.	0
This keyboard, although awesome while working, has a very common problem with its batteries exploding while inside of it and then becoming permanently lodged within the keyboard.  Google &#34;Apple wireless keyboard exploded batteries&#34; - this is a very common problem that Apple won't acknowledge.  The response from the genius tech when I brought mine into the apple store today was: &#34;All batteries are going to explode, just don't lick the acid!&#34;.  So basically I bought a $70 keyboard that Apple fully expects to be dead fairly soon after the warranty expires.<br /><br />If you do decide to buy this, an extended warranty would be well worth the small investment.	0
Although so far I haven't seen anything really that has blown me out of the water gaming wise, I see it's potential.  This year and next we should start seeing what it is truly made of.  My only other gripe is having to spend the extra money for the kinect which is something I don't really see myself using.	1
Amazing light weight watch that does everything for me that is needed. What appeals to me most is the large numbers which makes it easier to view at a glance	0
Ten words about how bad this tea is will be hard to do, so here we go, it's stale tasting, and last time I checked green tea had a green, and sweet taste.	0
My son really likes zelda so this was a must buy for him. Whenever he plays video games for the past 2 months or so it has always been this game. Ive only watched him play a few times, the graphics looked nice and it always keeps him very engaged. I dont like him playing a ton but I have no doubt he could play this game all day without getting bored.	1
Just received my watch case. It came double boxed and was really well packaged. The inner box had foam on top of the glass and the whole thing was also covered in a plastic wrap. Much better than what you usually see.<br /><br />Since the case was relatively cheap, I expected the usual low quality manufacturing. I was pleasantly surprised. The glass top is really glass, and the whole thing looks quite attractive. The top opens easily, the inserts are nice and sturdy.<br /><br />I was even happier when I saw that my larger Casio watches had room in the compartments. Usually they are too tight to fit well. I managed to fit my whole Casio collection in this case. The solar models are in the center so that they can still catch some light while protected in the box.<br /><br />I highly recommend this case, probably the best one in this price range. I would buy another if I needed more room for watches.	1
Love these for playing ball with dogs. It's everything we've been looking for, a ball that squeaks with a rope to play tug a war when she brings it back. Rope toys in general are much safer than other toys, especially if you have an aggressive chewer at home. The rope helps you throw the ball further easier and doubles for tug of war her favorite play. Excellent product! Dog loves it!	1
I bought this product one month ago since I started using this collar for my dog. so it gives my dog an opportunity to change his behavior. No more barking! Thanks!	1
This is a very heavy duty chord. It is exactly what we where looking for.  it is a very welcomed acc. in the camper and should be for along time.	0
I bought one of these for each of my 3 grandson's. They loved them. It is so neat to watch them wheel their own bag into grandma's and grandpa's house when they come to visit. The bags are a style that they won't grow too big for. The quality of the bag is great. Lots of pockets to put their favorite toys in.	1
Timex is re-inventing itself. Have got a couple compliments on it already. The leather strap is a bit stiff when it arrived, but I just bent the strap back and forth to relax the leather. Looks and works great!	1
Proceed with caution as normal, but these have been amazing for us with an infant. The scissors have slightly curved blades and the tips are rounded for extra protection. Emery boards did not work for us and the safety scissors in the baby kit did not cut anything.	1
It's a very beautiful watch, and it's incredibly light... but the metallic surface seems to scratch so easily! Is that normal with titanium?	0
Movies good quality and enjoyable would reccomend to people who like old westerns and plenty of action would recomend to western fans	0
I wanted to be able to practice chords anywhere since I am trying to learn to play the guitar. Pocket strings is fantastic! I took it on a trip 1/2 way around the world where traveling with a guitar would have been a pain. I learned chords very quickly with Pocket Strings. It feels like a real guitar neck!	0
I've been using this product for a while and it really calms me down, especially when I have to take exams. It is also helping me control my stress when work builds up. After calming down it is easier to organize my thoughts and start working. Surprisingly, I always feel healthier when taking these supplements. Overall happy with this purchase.	1
Look nice and they are pretty comfortable considering the price. I find these chairs well worth the price and space. highly recommended	1

I have Unreal Engine 4 so this book didn't really help me. It is really hard to find books on unreal engine 4 so I bought this book thinking that it might help a little and that there wasn't going to be big changes between Unreal 3 and 4 but I was wrong.	0
We bought these for our counter that sit over carpet.  They are sturdy and look great.  Pretty Easy to put together.  Wish I would have bought these first because I wasted money on different ones that were more expensive and not that nice.  Also, I purchased them on a Tuesday and they were delivered by Friday.	0
I purchased a cute little bamboo plant, known to bring luck, for my daughter who was having lots of bad luck. Well, it took a few weeks after it arrived but her luck did improve. I know that the plant wasn't the real secret to the change in her luck - but who knows- It was a great gift at a reasonable price!	1
Dear Doc Martin(s),<br /><br />My cousin Tuesday, who totally knows every super, fabulous being in Manhattan, drew a blank (literally on paper) when I mentioned your name. Hmm. I cannot bear to live with or without a mystery. I dispatched my brother Blake straightaway to the Astor estate and or compound on Long Island. After he left, I was hit with a worrisome thought; are the Astors still alive?! Another mystery I had to bear. An eternity passed and finally my brother phoned. Yes, the Astors were still among the mortal and hell no, you Doctor Wednesday, are not part of their reality.<br /><br />What I can tell you is this Miss Doctor Person; Wednesdays are for the middle of the week and &#34;Addams Family&#34; films.<br /><br />Yours Amid the Whirl,<br /><br />Christopher Roberts	1

I was in the mood for an action movie so I watched the blu-ray on this one. It was an action movie and not much else. Lots of things blue up and looked good doing it. Lots of people got got. There was a lot of action. The plot was flimsy all all counts. The acting was meh.. thought eh main character, Jed, played a credible role.	1
This little camera works quite well and the night vision was better than I expected. I purchased this camera to monitor my puppy while I am working at night because it has night vision, and you can talk through it.	1
I have watched this movie when I was in Korea. I ordered my own copy because I wanted to keep a copy of this amazing heart warming movie. It's based on a real story that is why it's very interesting. I really cried when i watched it and makes me feel very angry to all people who treats children like this. I think if everyone watch this their perception of life will change. I will definitely recommend this to all!	1
Since it's so inexpensive, I would recommend it to a friend. However, I would warn them that the liner has this giant stupid tag that you need to remove, but when you try to remove it, it will leave a big tear on the liner.	1
Two cons:<br />1.  The grip could be more substantial; it's too smooth<br />2.  The swivel clip doesn't feel right (compared to my previous Otter Box)<br /><br />Overall, though, I'm very pleased.  Definitely worth the money to protect delicate smart phones.	0
I've always loved zombie hot sauce the best.  It's quite hard to find them. I think this is a really great set to gift me.	1
If you are just looking to use a strobe in a small area this is probably a good buy for the money.Everything went smoothly. My purchase was in perfect condition. I recommend buying through this provider. You won't regret it.	1
Exactly what I expect from Herschel. Nice design, solid quality, no bells & whistles. Definitely recommend for the style and price, just nothing that stands out as better/more useful than any other similar products.	0
Such a great collection. I love this movie set so much, one of my favorites movies of all the time, great action as always. There are great scenes that will excite you a lot. I am so happy for this, the Blu-ray is amazing, the picture is remarkable good. Worth for the money, I will enjoy with this collection a lot, I will be watching over and over again. Thanks!	1
I always been in charge in a kitchen, from slicing, cooking and washing! in slicing different meets, vegetables or fruits I often cut my self. Maybe too much thinking and not concentrating. That's why, since it always been happening to me, which I don't know why? I really need to have a gloves to avoid or prevent from being hurt by cutting fingers unintentionally. its better to be safe! good thing I fond this one, and just this morning I tried it, because I was slicing some parts of the ribs, And It happens again. If I was not wearing the gloves, pretty sure, I was hurting my fingers again with the very sharp knife. Thanks for this glove that really made to protect your hands from cutting. The materials is really made of a high quality cloth and very durable. thanks for this, I wasn't hurt my self again/	1
This product is amazing!!! The design is genius!! It is very simple to use but just in case it does come with detailed directions! I would recommend this product to any and all!	1
I just wanted to purchase a modest desk chair for my home office, but I was skeptical of this one because of the small price, as compared to many others.  After reading the previous positive reviews, I purchased it.  Surprisingly, it was pretty easy to assemble and it works great and it's very comfortable.  A great bargain!.	0
These work great and are such a good alternative to cheese cloth. I use these to season my soup and what not, it works really good and they are super easy to use. I love that they are reusable and so handy!	1
My toddler is scared of water getting into her eyes and ears. This splashguard really helps make bath time easier and fun.	1
Sharp makes great TV's that surpass every other manufacturer in their class. I have two Samsung's in my house and I can tell you the image is beautiful. This TV has an LED screen and in my opinion this the way to go (LED is similar to LCD its back-lit better so that they are no dark spots on the screen).  Now add in that this TV can directly connect to the internet and I'm sold. TV's of this class have never been cheaper.  One thing that I have found with TV's that its very important to actually look at the TV in person. Now when you look at the TV's, go to a place like Walmart to see them, because many times specialty stores like Best Buy play with the lighting controls on the TV and in the store to skew the image to there advantage. Once you look at the TV simply look and decide which one looks better to you.   Additionally I found this mount to be very helpful http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00K69M0TY  The next step to take into consideration is features. Here are a few that come with this TV:  This Samsung comes with Auto Volume which automatically adjusts the volume of the desired channel, lowering the sound output when the modulation signal is high or raising the sound output when the modulation signal is low. This reduces the difference in volume when changing channels. The Auto Volume feature can be set to Normal, Night or Off.  With this Smart HDTV there is a full web browser with WiFi built-in apps made for TV. Some of the apps this TV features is Hulu Plus, YouTube, Netflix, Facebook, and Twitter. Browse the web while you watch movies and TV shows, and enjoy TV while you chat with friends and family online, all on one screen with this Samsung.  As far as outputs most of these TV's will come with more than enough Inputs and Outputs. This TV comes with 4 HDMI Audio/Video In, 1 Ethernet LAN In/Out, 1 RCA Component Audio/Video In amd 1 Digital Coaxial Audio Out.  Next thing when shopping for a TV is in box technology. Here are some of the features of thisTV:  Thank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.	1
This book takes what could be an overwhelming process and boils it down to the basics.  Gives you what you need to know to start NOW!	0
Fits my 17&#34; laptop like a glove.  All other compartments are extremely useful and sufficient for all of my little gadgets, one 1-1/2 3-ring binder, and a lunch sack!  The construction quality is bar none as its name bares.  I originally had a bit of reservation about the quality of the wheel (for not having seen and felt it), but now that I have used it for over three months, everything is holding up like a Samsonite should do!  And the wheels are a life saver too considering the total weight of around 25lbs between the bag itself and all of the contents on my average day, that I can roll around instead of wearing it on my shoulder.<br /><br />Highly recommend this to anyone who have a need to lug around a heavy lap top and some ....	0
I had a excellent support experience with Calvin. He was very thorough and patient. I highly recommend Foscam and the support. As a first time user, my experience with the camera has been great.	0
I like the way this fits my dog.  She has some pretty bad back issues so I don't like to torture her with a collar and leash but she loves walks.  This fits her well and I feel like it is not putting any strain on her neck or back.  She seems happy and comfortable!	1
This unit was compared to devices providing Widi and Chromcast support and found to be one of the best solutions.  The Aries Prime was used to transmit various types of media from a low-cost laptop to an HD TV and never failed to deliver a perfect image and robust audio.  The installation was nearly effortless and worked the first and every time there after.<br /><br />If you require a means of transmitting your PC's screen image to a TV, this is one of the best solutions on the market.	0
I´ve been having some wrist and knee pain/swelling recently and my friend recommended me these, saying they helped him out with some osteoarthritis he was having. They have definitely brought down both the joint pain and inflammation over the last month of taking them. Great buy.	0
Compared to my other Whoopie Pie cookbook, this one is user friendly -- at least for the first section of the book. A recipe for the cake is on one page and the suggested filling recipe follows on the next. Of course the user is free to mix-up cakes and fillings but it is nice to have the basics follow in sequential order rather than chapters filled with nothing but cakes and some filled with nothing but fillings so the user must jump from one section to the next.  The book is a paperback so it doesn't lay open flat on the countertop. The use of a cookbook holder might be helpful. The ink color for the recipes and instructions is mercifully, black, so even with the small font size it is relatively easy to read. The paper quality is good and promptly wiped-up spills did not sink in and cause permanent damage. There is a solid index in the back so locating a particular recipe is easy. The measurements are given in grams and ounces. The majority of necessary ingredients are readily available in grocery stores, but golden syrup will require a search.  I made the Carrot Cake Whoopie pie along with the recommended Orange Mascarpone Cream filling. The combination was excellent and I won't hesitate to prepare it again, although I plan to try other varieties.  Recipes included in the Simple and Sweet section of the book are Chocolate with Fluffy Marshmallow filling, Mocha-Orange with Espresso cream filling, Pumpkin with Cream Cheese filling, Strawberry with Strawberry buttercream, Chocolate Chip with Chocolate Marshmallow cream, Carrot Cake with Orange Mascarpone cream, Lemon Cream with Lemon Curd cream, Red Velvet with Old Fashioned buttercream and Salty Caramel with Caramel Swiss buttercream.  Moving into the next few sections of the book the organization starts to drift a bit between icings, glazes, whoopie pie cakes, fillings and buttercreams. Recipes include, Teacake Whoopie, Chocolate icing, Kirsch Swiss buttercream, Rose-Pistachio Whoopie, Rosewater icing, Plain icing, Vanilla Swiss buttercream, Walnut Whip Whoopie, Meringue Whoopie, Chestnut cream, Coconut Cream Whoopie, Coconut Swiss buttercream, Coconut glaze, Raspberry and Nectarine Whoopie, Vanilla Bean cream, Raspberry Sauce, Blackberry Whoopie, Blackberry cream, Blackberry-Geranium sauce, Rhubarb & Custard Whoopie, Roasted Rhubarb, Banana Cream Whoopie, Chocolate Sauce and Shavings, Salty Caramel Sauce and Vanilla Custard Cream.  Recipes for Frozen and Chilled Whoopies where ice cream is used or an accompanying noted filling include, Oatmeal Cookie Whoopie (use vanilla ice cream,) Key Lime Whoopie, frozen Key Lime cream, Chocolate Mint Whoopie and frozen Mint Chip cream. Holiday treats include Christmas Cake Whoopie, Brown Sugar Spice buttercream, Spooky Halloween Whoopie, Easter Egg Whoopie and Multicolored Buttercreams.  Completely puzzling, at this point the book abandons its subject -- Whoopie Pies --and includes recipes for S'mores (yes, basic graham cracker, chocolate bar and toasted marshmallow s'mores,) Peanut Butter sandwich cookies with peanut butter filling, Easy Chocolate Macaroons, Chocolate-Caramel Ganache, Prize Peach Cobbler, Butterscotch Blondies and finally a Brownie Sundae.  The book's organization is a bit confusing and decisions like the inclusions in the last chapter simply strange, but the recipe I prepared was delicious and I look forward to trying more.	0
I bought these bags for my kids for weekend trips to Grandma's house and short road trips. They are just the right size and they are such good quality. It really looks like my kids will get years of good use out of these. I love that the kids can be responsible for their own bags and transport them easily with the wheels.	1
While the stool is nice...It made my bad back worse, not better. After an hour sitting on this stool my back was hurting so bad I could barely walk. The seat is hard as a brick and the pressure it put on my sciatic nerve was excruciating. Wasn't easy disassembling the stool, but it is on the way back as I write this review.	0
I love the size of the cubes BUT:<br />the internal dividers are equal height to the outside of the tray so you can't fill them up without spilling some of the water:<br />once frozen the ice is very hard to get out of the trays.  Yes, I tried letting them set for up to 90 seconds but the trays still would not releast the cubes and who want to stand around waiting for over two minutes for ice.	0
Wow!  Beautiful watch!.  I have quite a collection of watches but this one stands out as a beauty.  I received it in a timely manner and am Very happy with the watch and the great customer service that Amazon provides.	0
http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/1633440303 is a game for two players set in the dystopian future of Android . It pits monolothic megacorps against subversive netrunners in a high-stakes struggle for the control of valuable data.  With its sixty cards (a complete playset of twenty-two different cards), The Valley explores Biotech Valley and its massive investment into bleeding-edge bioengineering.   This is a meatspace heavily colored by genengineering, a highly educated workforce, tech startups, capital investments, and the presence of Jinteki’s J-Plex. You’ll find numerous assets, region ugrades, genetic resources, and a new Jinteki identity. Of course, even in the Valley, you’ll need more than good genes to get by; you’ll also find new programs, ice, and currents for both Corps and Runners.  I recommend checking out http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/1633440303  I hope this review was helpful!	1
I have the very first Sega Genesis system to come out still from my childhood.  It's always worked, but when I tried to plug it directly into my flat screen, the picture wouldn't come up.  So, after being told by other people to buy a new system that'll play it and me being too nostalgic to give up my old school sega, I found this.  Such an easy fix.  Now I can play Aladdin and Sonic 'til my heart's content.	0
I love this serum because of the Moisturizing my skin. I'm seeing some improvements. The cream works a moisturizer because it leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth for long hours.	1
Great product it really works ! It's simple and easy to use! It keep you Regular and give you alot if energy	0
Great product, worked exactly as it was supposed to.  Very good instructions included, easily followed.	0
Excellent visual quality. Reduces glare. Does not show finger Prints. This screen was easy for me to put on. I got it on the first try and it fit perfectly.	1
I've bought these 1/4 inch hex skank to 1/2 inch socket adapter to be used with my DeWALT DCF885 impact driver. I'm currently using the driver at work where I have to fasten a lot of millimetric bolts. The sizes I mostly fasten range from 13 to 17 millimeters.<br /><br />The material:<br />This adapter is made of an impact resistant steel, coated with a black smooth non-reflective material. The steel is of a great quality, because I've been using it for at least 6 months and it didn't shatter, didn't show markings, scratches and is really corrosion resistant.<br /><br />The design:<br />This adapter has a simple yet effective design. It fits perfectly to my impact driver and is really easy to attach to many different sockets. The adapter has a ball-and-spring locking mechanism which found itself really sturdy for many applications. The way I work, I have to keep on switching between sockets all day long and after 6 months of continuous use the mechanism still works as new.<br /><br />Overall:<br />It's worth a 5 star overall rating. It's tough, it's corrosion resistant, it's locking mechanism works fine, it's impact resistant and it's cheap for the quality you get. I totally recommend it.	0
I bought these heated socks with hopes that they would help with my sub-freezing bicycle commute.  Unfortunately, they are very primitively constructed and generate very little heat.  The battery pack is just a nylon sack with a snap which gives a very questionable connection a the single D cell.  There is no on/off switch -- you have to unsnap the cover on the pack.  The heating "element" is just a wire sewn into the toe that measures about 1/8 x 2 ".    The deal killer is the minimal heat generation.    The socks are very comfortable, but for $40 you can obtain many pairs of better socks.  This one is getting sent back but Amazon is telling me I may have to eat the shipping.    Looks like I am going to blacklist Turtle Fur!!!	0
I bought this because it was BPA free and had a narrow mouth.  The widemouth also splashes me in the face.  Even with the silicon splash guard, the wide mouth bottle would leak down my clothes.<br /><br />It gets a little tedious putting ice in the narrow mouth but is worth it.  I really like this water bottle and plan on only purchasing the narrow mouth bottles from now on.	0
This radio is horrid. Upon first inspection it might be a good cheap radio to hold you over until you can afford a better one, but it's not even worth that title. It doesn't work! The casing is horrible. Hate it.	1
always good to have extra ammo at hand. i have several of these. most convenient way to carry extra ammo.	0
A perfect gift for everyone who loves their kitchen. A must buy product for every kitchen. A Sturdy enamel-coated cast-iron body Apple peeler which has ABS plastic handles. This solid basic tool is unique and very useful at the time of peeling off the fruits!	1
Seriously, $6.95. I wasn't expecting much but after playing around with the antenna I managed to get more channels than I had before so I have absolutely 0 complaints. Will have to wait and see how long it lasts but at this price, who cares, I can just get another one!	1
brand new as described exactly, good pictures, clear sound , couldn't play subtitles so i'm not sure if it is available, works with almost all of my media player's	0
Superbly made. Super-heavy. They honestly don't feel like 90 lbs. Feels like someone's hidden a team of clowns in there, and there's a party going on.<br /><br />Difficult to handle... just the way I like it.<br /><br />Already feeling the gains coming :-)<br /><br />p.s. My clients hate these bells. This makes me love 'em even more.	0
As a musician I always make sure that everything I will use is in good condition specially when I have a gig. This guitar strap is good because its solid and made well. Easy to adjust and comfortable to use.	1
Everything was as it should be. The product is exactly what I paid for. Make sure to read the product description for its dimensions because everything tends to &#34;look&#34; bigger in pictures.	0
Unlike other aftermarket cabin air filters, the TYC filter is just like OEM, well built, good solid feel to it. Other aftermarket brands that I have tried are flimsy and don't fit as well and usually cost more. This includes all the different TYC filters that I have bought for Honda Accords, Civics, CRVs, Acura MDXs, TLs, etc.	0
as i am not a die hard fountain pen user, but it's really good product i found on amazon,best price Best product, nice packaging & Super fast delivery . 5 Stars from my side	1
Corsair is a trusted vendor for my Biz/hobie. I love it when I don't have to work for a living; phew. sometimes its a job reviewing this stuff. I suggest if you want accurate data you don't require a Novel like the Microsoft folk do.	0
Outstanding product ! Multi purpose, a must have for a power outage. I bought six for throughout the house, they work fantastic ! highly recommend. These will keep you from stumbling around in the dark looking for a flashlight , a Safety must !!	1
I gave this one to my father when he turned 50. He loved it soo much that he used it on special occasions and didn't want to scratch it. I eventually convinced him to wear it daily... now, after 4 years runs perfectly. Seiko is really a brand that delivers. I don't like too much the strap but can't really complain...	1
Great for closet shelves and chests of drawers.  It keeps all insects away, especially moths and it smells a whole lot nicer than moth balls.	0
I like the taste of these biscuits a lot. I use to eat multiple packs per dat but nothing happens. They are not as digestive of I have expected, but, I love their flavor.	1
Amazing voice, good shots behind the scenes.live concert video, and interactions with rest of her troupe. I would e commend this.	0
It's so much easier than I thought it would be. No valves to worry about and only a few notes to learn. I've been practicing with a few books that I bought on Amazon (The U.S. Navy Manual for Buglers, Mel Bay's The Bugler's Handbook, and Fun with the Bugle) and also with the America's Bugle Calls CD.	1
Just got back from the colorado mountains.  It was a nice trip, my first time to try to ski.  I really had fun.  For beginners, this ski mask is sufficient but I was advised that the next time I try skiing, I'll need a better mask,something more breathable.	1
I'm very upset. I bought these in February. I print 5-10 coupons every to weeks to do my shopping. Additionally, I printed a single label. It's already requesting a refill on 4/23. Something is very, very wrong here. I've ordered ink cartridges before and I have never had one dry out so quick. I've requested a refund and he won't give me my money back. He's told me I can file a claim with the manufacturer that makes me VERY skeptical that he's done this before.	1
I got this hoping to get a decent set at home but it didn't turn out that way. First, the smell of this set is nothing short of toxic. The chemical smell they come with is nauseating and fills an entire room. I tried wiping them down but it didn't seem to help and after some inspection noticed there was a warning label about the chemicals used being linked to cancer and birth defects. Also, the kit doesn't even come with enough weight to even reach 40 lbs. I weighed all the weights and they equal 38 lbs, which is with the 4 lb bar itself.<br /><br />After getting rid of these I got myself a set of dumbbells I absolutely love. I got them around a month ago and I can't find a single thing to complain about. The max weight and combination of weights included are endless. I'm so happy I bought the set.<br /><br />If you want a quality set of dumbbells, then get the same set I did here on Amazon ---------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r0BiNN<br /><br />I hope I could help point others in the right direction and keep them from making the same mistake I did!	1
The chair is very good for my back. It forces me to stay upright. However, all my weight is transferred to my shins which makes them very sore after an hour or so...	0
These gloves lasted a bit longer before the middle finger stitching gave way. They are still a good option for gardening gloves. They rip out faster when wet.	1
The color is not exact to the picture shown which is extremely disappointing. How can you sell something when it is way off from the description. Completely throws off what i was going to use them for.	1
The Kor One &#34;Hydration Vessel&#34; has a pretentious name, but it's a beautifully designed product. Easy to carry. Easy to open. Easy to fill. Big enough for ice cubes. Surprisingly heavy duty so it will last.<br /><br />I love it and has been using it.<br /><br />To clean your bottle in a more effective way, I bought the following product:<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004OCLJ?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393177&creativeASIN=B00004OCLJ&linkCode=shr&tag=derdigki-20	1
I have always wanted a NAS on my network but alot of them have been over priced . I did not want to have to pay in the 300 to 400 buck range for a hard drive and NAS. I saw a review about the Tonido on youtube and with the price of only 119 bucks I decided to buy. The Software at first was a little hard to use but after a few hours it came to me. The software is more for geeks but if you have ever went into a router and changed some setting then you should have not problem with the tonidoplug. It can do worlds more then I thought it could even without me having to do much.  It took no time to find out how to connect it over my network to my mac using the lan to add files or how to stream movies from it to the VLC player on my mac. This is the perfect little device that I wanted and I have told friend about who are thinking about buying one.<br /><br />If you are a geek looking to make your own cloud or have your own person how server then the TonidoPlug2 is for you.	0
Expected something more. Must admit visual effect looks fab however story line is really boring. Do not know why this movie was rated so high.	1
From my awesome teenager son with love for his mother! It is beautiful! Dainty and feminine! Looks long lasting too! Quite bowled over!	1
Bought this game for my son, but I had to play it first as the game is awesome.<br /><br />Though we have completed the missions it is still fun to retry them again	1
it is really amazing and I never expect this much quality and gripes in the product, so I love it very much	1
I totally enjoyed this movie. I can't wait to purchase the Blu-ray version, it's a must watch if you love movies about conspiracy. It's action packed and very thrilling. Can't wait for the part 2.	1
My disc had a problem with freezing so I never had a chance to try and play all the way through the game, but this is not a game for anyone but very serious gamers.  The instructions are quite complex, the controls hard to manage as it takes many minutes to understand what they are for.  I found it the least user friendly Xbox game I have owned.  It was almost a relief when I finally gave up trying to play through the freezes by restarting new games.  Even using your weapons to shoot an enemy was unusually difficult for us as you didn't know what that particular weapon's capabilities were without reading long instructions.<br /><br />If you are into games with minutes and minutes of scenes and dialogue before you ever get to play, and you are experienced or patient enough to learn the intricacies, then this might be a super game.  It wasn't for us.	0
Watch was shipped quickly. Image is very true representation of the product. I have a small wrists and I am still able to wear the watch.	1
It fits well and all but was pretty pricey for something so thin. Also, no blingy audi logos! I couldn;t even find the word Audi on it.	1
The drone I used before broke within the first week of use and I thought I'd give this one a try and I was not disappointed. I've had this for months now and I never get tired of using this. I must say the quality of this drone in particular is very good and can withstand drops from great heights.	1
There was a great ease of finding this product on amazon. The pricing was incredible. It shipped very quickly, and it was indeed the part I ordered and it fit my vehicle as advertised.	0
The best case I ever owned.  It is great product and I like it very much.  it feels good in the hands	0
These worked perfectly and they cost less too! These are definitely Brother cartridges, if you inspect the cartridge, the original Brother logo is still on there. An OEM set is about $270, so these will save you over $100.	1
I thought it would be more of an accent, but was pleasantly surprised to find that it was bright enough to light up the whole room. The "paper" shading does soften the light though making it easy to function without a glare. It takes the tiny E12 bulbs (three of them). Another nice feature is the on/off foot switch. It was incredibly easy to assemble (i think it took me a grand total of two minutes to put it together and plug it in).	1
Utterly compelling video of Bruce trying to finish recording Darkness at the End of Town.  You don't have to look too closely to see exactly why Elvis and Michael Jackson ended up the way they did.  Everyone around Bruce is there to serve his music and that is understandable but the truly dark side of this is that the people around him need to maintain their place in his life to maintain their place in rock and roll so they allow him the freedom to self-destruct. There is at least one scene in which Bruce displays textbook mania. Springsteen is right to be glad he's still alive. I'm glad too!	0
The lights come with 8 settings, a delightful surprise. I'm using them to decorate my dorm room, and I am very pleased with the quality of light I'm getting. 10M is longer than it sounds, which ended up being a plus. A good item for the price. If I had any complaints it would be that the cord could be longer, but ultimately I'm satisfied.	1
This little makeup bag/case is to die for . I love love love it . It is the prefect size i needed for all the make i have . I love the black with pink pock a dots . It has 2 layers . The top layer i use for my little things , Like lip liners , lips sticks, mascaras things like that . Then the bottom layer for my bigger stuff  , like foundations , blushes , eye shadows stuff like that . It works out great for my made well , great quality  and very durable too  .<br /><br /> *This item was purchased *	1
I bought the ring, everything was perfect except that it was a little bit loose (absolutely my fault; I should have ordered a smaller size). I asked for exchange, and they immediately sent me one. Very nice!!	0
For $5.81 this four piece - 2 1/4&#34; herb pollen grinder is fairly well made.  The Aluminum is machined well and it looks good.  I do have a little trouble getting the threaded pieces to start threading again after taking it apart and this could be better in another unit than mine. Stainless steel or Brass would be a better material than Aluminum.  It does have a pretty powerful Neodymium<br />Magnets for the inner piece, which allows it to come apart to load the grinder. It has diamond shaped teeth for grinding and a<br />Stainless Steel Pollen Screen and an Nylon &#34;O&#34; ring for whatever purpose it serves, I am not sure.  I like it, but I don't have the herb to grind.	0
Very convenient.  Keep a roll or one bag in your pocket at all times.  Easy to pull a bag off the roll by sliding thumb nail along the bag to the bottom where there is a little slot where your nail catches in and the bag can be easily removed from the roll.  There is no plastic tube in the center which makes the roll flatten a little in your pocket and is more comfortable.  Who needs a dispenser!  Just more plastic junk that breaks.<br />I've used them for several weeks now without any problems whatsoever:  No seams splitting, no smells, no see through.  The bag is long enough to tie in a knot.  My dog is a French bulldog so the size is adequate..  The bag is probably big enough for up to medium - medium/large dogs.  I recommend this product without any reservations.	0
Deeteck Ultra-Thin Indoor HDTV Antenna is just a scam. I buy this product few days ago and if any customer ask me about this scam product i must say dont buy. Its totally waste of money. Picture quality is horrible. HDTV lolz... its like a .... Anyway if you rely on me leave it!	1
This hands-free breastpump bra, is hands down (or up, or really wherever you want them!) the best investment you can make for your pumping efforts -- besides a quality pump, of course. Thus far, I have only been using this bra at home (I go back to work later this week), but I have managed to pump nearly 70 ounces using this bra, and I can't imagine doing it any other way. It makes pumping such a breeze, and frees my hands up to do other things (or even just relax). In fact, I'm wearing it and pumping RIGHT NOW, as I type this review at 80 wpm!<br /><br />I use the Ameda Purely Yours, and the flanges fit and hold perfectly. I can't imagine a flange for any pump that wouldn't work. The bra holds the flanges snug and securely against my breast, without being constricting or uncomfortable at all. It feels like I'm just wearing my favorite sports bra. The fabric is very soft and would be comfortable to wear all day, if you wish (and you can add straps to it, to facilitate this). I find it easy enough to throw on over my bra, with the nursing flaps folded down, whenever I'm ready to pump.<br /><br />Sizing the bra was easy. I bought the XS/S/M size. I typically wear size Medium or size 10 tops. My bust is a 36D. There's a Velcro panel on the back that you can adjust as much or as little as you need. I have mine attached about an inch from each edge of the piece. There is also an extender piece that zips on/off in the front, allowing you to make it a little bigger, and also to adjust where the holes are so they line up with where your nipples are. I do not need to use that extender piece. With my sizing, I'd say I'm at the upper end of the size range for the XS/S/M size. Regardless, it fits perfectly and comfortably, and I don't see any reason why I'd need to size up.<br /><br />I've been using it for 2.5 months now, and it still looks brand new. The quality and construction are great, and I see no reason it won't last me a long time.<br /><br />I really can't imagine pumping without it. The only time I've ever not used it was when I've used a manual pump, but it's such a drag having to hold the pump against your breast -- I can't imagine trying to double pump without it (and having to hold the flanges onto your breasts with one or both hands -- certainly not relaxing!). It's nice to have your hands free to read a book, fiddle with the switches on the pump, continue doing your work, or even to do breast compressions if you need a little extra help with pumping. And since being relaxed is key to pumping well, this bra makes that so much easier, making it truly a must have!	0
My husband has several smallish skin tags around his neck and has been applying 3 times/day Dr. King's Natural Skin tag remover.  The instructions say to apply it 3 times each day for 4 to 6 weeks.  I have to give this product a review before then, so all I can say is that it smells like turpentine.  My husband waved the open bottle under my nose and asked me what I thought it smelled like and it definitely smelled like turpentine.  The active ingredient listed is: Thuja occidentalis.  According to Wikipedia it is this:<br /><br />  Thuja occidentalis is an evergreen coniferous tree, in the cypress family Cupressaceae, which is native to the northeast of the United States and the southeast of Canada, but widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.<br /><br />There's a lot more said about it, but it's a tree.  He will continue the treatment as instructed on the box, but in all honesty, dental floss is a lot easier, cheaper and a lot quicker when it comes to removing skin tags.	0
Fantastic price for such a lovely artificial tree. This makes a great addition the ones already in my house. This tree is my new favorite!	1
This garden hose washer and end cap kit has all the small parts needed to have what you need just when you need it. The parts and quantities are well chosen and I saved time by making one simple buy for the several parts I needed to begin watering my own yard and lawn.	0
This item is more than useless, it has absolutely no value whatsoever.  It is extremely small, and the sound it emits is barely audible, and what you can hear, is muffled, with scratch sounds? I do not recommend this item....	0
This system uses a separate-single humbucker system (two individual coils wired to counteract hum).  The sound is good.  If one wishes to use them to make a cigar box guitar they can be cut apart and used individually (with proper hum control ie, ground the strings to the jack).  Good set for the price.	0
Great for making apitizers. It's quick, delicious, and makes things they way they were made to be made - deep fried!	1
ordered it monday, came thursday.  needed one for my son's' science project.  He's measuring temperature changes at various points in his environment during the day, so got him infrared.  if you've never used one but you check temps frequently, this is what you need.  you just aim and shoot, the sucker tells you where you are pointing with a laser! light as a feather.	1
It's really great to have one of these at home since we are eating rice every morning (specifically, brown rice). I can wash the rice fast and efficiently using this bowl and it even drains the water quickly. I also like that you can actually squeeze it tight so that the water can get out on whatever you'd like to wash. I have tried veggies and fruits as well and I really like this tool, saves me time and energy. like to buy another one for my mom, she would love this.	1
I would give 2 1/2 stars as it was about half of what I expected.  Bagels have to be toasted on max and again set to about the 3 setting for my liking.  White toast is set 7 clicks back from max.  It was not much better than my $9.99 toaster it replaced.	0
I have been taking 2 of these capsules a day for a year for their anti-inflammatory properties and am very happy with them. Other brands do not have as much Curcumin in them as this.	1
This Size S short was a perfect fit for me.  I am 5' 5&#34; and weigh 108 lbs. and normally wear a size 2 pant.  I ordered this same sized short in a white, and the white were way too big.  Odd. These shorts hit closer to the knee than others I tried which is nice for a change.	0
I just got these a few days ago and have not stopped using them, really impressed with the overall product. The features are really excellent, you can walk around the house doing laundry, vacuuming and cleaning while enjoying music (I usually stream Pandora or my Apple radio app) and the sound quality is loud and very nice. What I love most about this is when someone calls you, you can hear your phone ringing without knowing where your phone is to answer the call - just press the button on the side and boom you're talking to whoever called you. That's surely amazing and I haven't seen a feature like this. The other party just does not know I am on a headset and they are impressed every time I tell them. The range is also very good I can go around 30 feet and no loss of signal and quality. The headphone looks great, I love the black and red design, the buttons feel great and the pads are soooo soft wow. I can definitely say without thinking twice that this is an excellent little headset with some cool technology.	1
I got this for my wife and  ordered for size 5 but it looks a bit bigger to the usual size of 5.<br />She able to use it few days and she already keep it in the shoes cabinet.	1
I feel this is really a value for money. It looks stylish and design and make is also good. Quality is good. the only cons is the tip of the hammer which is really small else everything is really good. good product.	1
I used this on my 98 Honda Civic EX. My AC was barely putting out any cool air before I used this product. My AC works really great now and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Took only one can to do the job.	0
These pens are absolutely fantastic!  It works well with this: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0008G8G8Y?tag=i60-20  I had originally been turned on to these pens when I had come across an article showing that these Sakura pens had the best chemical, heat, and moisture resistance.  Found here: [...]  Ink stability is tantamount in a notebook for company or personal use. I can write with confidence knowing that my writing won't smear or fade and possibly lead me in a touchy legal situation.  I also really like the fact that the caps STAY on the opposite ends when writing, unlike some pens which don't positively lock on and fall off, eventually being lost.  My only gripe is that I'm often afraid of bending the tips of the smaller diameter pens.  I use these pens at work in labs to document my findings and observations, as well as to draw any intellectual property that may be used in legal disputes. REMEMBER, your word is only as good as your documentation, engineers!  Side note: A lot of the people who use the pens are incorrectly describing the sizes. The pen designation is a #005 and not it's diameter, not .005in, or 0.005mm. That #005 is 0.20mm in diameter, the &#34;&#34;#&#34;&#34; does not directly correlate to the pen diameter.	1
Its some metal shaped in a way that holds my water bottle on my bike. Not many ways you can mess that up. This one is simple, painted well, and attractive on my bike. Fits my bottle perfectly.	0
I have programmed this spare no problems using the car computer as instructed.  No problems thus far.  Quality is excellent, OEM quality.  I recommend this product.	0
It's a very great value for the price. It's a well-made medicine ball that's perfect in shape and size and weight.	1
I'm moving at the end of the month and these bags have been a life saver. I've been able to pack things up to place in storage, packed away comforters and empty several dressers for easy moving. They work great.	1
I really like this. Seems to stop the chlorine smell and since I take bathes often, knowing the water is not coming straight from the faucet gives me piece of mind. I never thought about what is in the bath water (city water) and even if the bath ball filter doesn't remove most of the chemicals, anything it removes is good enough for me.	0
This is one color I didn't have for my 3 baby Lupah watches (silver, gold, rose gold) with the interchangeable straps-this fix perfectly! I love the sunny color!	0
This is an easy (and, I think) non-toxic product to use as a conditioner for wood salad bowls and cutting boards. Highly recommend.	0
It's functional, classy, hip, pretty, easy to get to, ALL functional without removing, please keep making these exact same flip covers in different colors, how about whites and more beading and glitter. ..we ladies LOVE a statement. ...this is exactly like it was described. .thanks Karen	0
I gave a five star rating for excellent performance and quality.Stanley tools make excellent affordable tools.I highly recommend this product	0
very good and bright. it will pick up anything that should not be there. loose something in a carpet, it will find it. plus the rest of what it offers.	0
It's a great product and does pretty much what I needed it for. I would recommend this to friends of it continues to be good after a while.	1
The price of the router should have been a giveaway but I was hoping to upgrade from the cheap router I had originally. I saw the good reviews and hoped I would get an increase in performance from my internet.<br /><br />What I actually got was a smaller signal and lower speeds that I originally had before. I'm not an expert but I don't see how that is possible based on what the people said giving this 5 stars.<br /><br />I dealt with this router for a while before finally I had enough and did some research. I ended up finding a router that was a BIG difference in quality and performance.<br /><br />I get full connection anywhere in my three story house as well as even outside. I love it!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon ----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nixMuc<br /><br />It is probably one of the best investments I've ever made! If it's not for you, at least I could share my experience!	1
My 6 yr Old Son Loves this<br />I wish it was a little less Bulky and trigger didn't need as much strength to pull<br /><br />But at the end of the day, the kid can not stop playing with it	1
This one I bought for my office use. I must say this one is the most attractive in its price range and quality. Great quality leather for rough and tough use. Very comfortable padding for shoulders. I give it 5 stars for look and feel and for it being nicely designed with zippered compartments and it's roominess. Thank you VOCHIC for this great product.	1
This bracelet looks good when you receive it.  But once you use it a few times it scuffs up really easily.  I have a desk job where I do not do a lot of rugged moving.  So I'm still a little curious why this bracelet is scuffing while I mostly type on a keyboard?	0
Colorful, easy to spot, regular luggage tag size. Not as sturdy as I hoped, but seems to have potential to endure our minimal travels.	1
I grew up in Maryland and spent many summers enjoying the delicious pickled onions made by my grandmother and was so sad when I moved to New Jersey and could only find them as cocktail onions. These are not as big as the ones from my childhood but just as tasty. Only wish they were not quite so pricey.	0
It kept my skin soft and hydrated during radiation treatment, however I really only needed to purchase 2 bottles and I was told I needed 4.	0
The gates are very easy to set in place and to remove them.<br />Easy latch and use.<br />I am very pleased with the delivery and quality.<br />Paul	0
My granddaughter loved it! It comes with a web site to download games, music and other activities. Needs assistance from an adult to set up, but then it is so much fun. Great learning tool for the little ones!	1
I love to use bike every day and I have purchased many bike lights in my life. Almost all were somehow difficult to use. The quality, too dim or the battery died quickly, something.<br /><br />I was in a need to purchase a new light and not long ago I came across this one. When I receive the light, I found it to be surprisingly bright, brighter than any flash light or bike light I brought in the past. I am really delighted about the high quality machining as well. The head and the tail turns very smoothly just like my Nikon camera lens.<br /><br />I sometimes feel that the High mode is too bright and when I want to save battery life I just its medium mode that is bright enough.  I found even the low mode is as bright as the other bike lights I had. I like the "half press” feature of the tail button that changes the mode much easier than other bike lights.<br /><br /> I sometimes commute to and from work in the dark and this light has kept me safe. Great value for the cost.<br /><br />Undoubtedly, this waterproof, astonishing bright LED light is not difficult to use. It is recommended by me to all bike lovers!	1
It is not a thin stroller but out of this problem,just the perfect car for my twins! We are very happy with my purchase :)	0
I've used a lot of regular 19" racks that are 12" or longer deep, so it was great finding this shorter rack.  I use it to mount various components including my dual and single shures, video switch boxes, routers, etc.  Even with all of the holes, if that doesn't suit you then just Velcro it.  And this price is exceptional, the exact same thing on two other sellers is three times the price!  Stock up on them for they will always come in handy wherever you may need to rack an item and not want a full rack to do it.	0
This broke way too fast! I might have pulled on it a little too hard and too quick though, so it's partially my fault. Still, for a toy for dogs, this should have been a lot tougher.	1
Satisfied with online shopping, the seller carefully, underwear fabric breathable, comfortable to wear, packaging, regardless of price or quality, it is recommended, like this one, and then later.	1
You really get what you paid for with these olives, and I mean that in the most literal way I can. There is so much packed into the container and they are all in great condition as well. This is super, super worth it as far as I'm concerned.	1
The case formed some sort of cloudy white marks and it doesn't wash off. I couldn't quite figure out what they are and how they formed but I've used similar cases in the past and didn't have this problem.	1
The earrings are really cute and sturdy. The joint of it works well.<br />Aslo they are basic style, nothing fancy, but it will keep you in fashion even after 10 years.<br />That's a steal for the price.	1
I have seen better shows of his. This one was too hyped up from the beginning and they were fighting scripted obviously!	1
The interesting thing is that I just finished reading the 50 Shades trilogy so reading this so quickly afterwards really showcased how superficial the 50 Shades series was and how deep this lovely novel is. 50 Shades is like commercial candy and this book is like a finely made Swiss chocolate.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect when reading this. It began somewhat depressing, a woman feeling trapped in the routine and exhaustion of her married life with kids. Haven't we all felt somewhat downtrodden when our kids are young and we lose our way in cleaning up, feeding, and answering questions?<br /><br />But then it backtracks to her life in the Australian bush and as she begins to grow and blossom into puberty and feeling the power of her own sexuality she reaches out to others to test the power of her new found growth. Naivety puts her in some awkward situations (and as a parent, I found them rather scary) but she is also longing for the returned love of a man as her father has seemingly removed himself from showing signs of love and affection.<br /><br />And then she discovered an old house, seemingly abandoned, that becomes the setting for the biggest change in her life. A time of exploration, blossoming, lessons, love, reflection, growth, turmoil, soul searching and also what often holds her back from living the rest of her life with freedom and abandon.<br /><br />The fact that this is mostly about the relationship (and sexual growth and experimentation) between a young man and a teenage girl is certainly controversial but I don't think it was written to be a political stand on sex with a minor. We never really know her age but since she still has to go back to school at the end of her summer I assumed she was 16 or 17.<br /><br />The writing style is very different than a traditional chapter by chapter story unfolding since we always hear from the first person is snippets of short chapters with very little fill in.<br /><br />What was amazing was how wellit conveys the struggle a woman can go through with sexuality, the power behind it, and the deep emotional feelings that accompany that aspect of a woman. I was really pleased with where the story ended. Just right.<br /><br />It may not be a book for everyone but the writing and intensity of the relationship was beautiful - and heartbreaking.	0
My old pocket watch has been given a new life by being displayed in this handsome and practical glass dome. The price was right, and delivery was prompt.	0
I'm familiar with music stands...having owned several over the years I knew the importance in having a wide base for support. This is crucial, especially in this case where it supports heavier items. I feel very safe working from the stand. It is physically designed to handle heavier weight on top and remains stable.  It stands at a nice working height when fully extended, I stand 5'11 and use it comfortably.	1
Never having done exercises for scoliosis before and being one of these people who struggle with co-ordination and always turn in the wrong direction in the fitness class, I wanted an easy to follow routine and clear instructions. And this DVD delivers exactly that (and if I loose a few pounds on the way, even better). Even though the pace is reasonably gentle, I actually got quite hot and my heart rate definitely went up. My mum and dad saids they can tell the difference and my posture and hump on my back looks better than it has in many years. I just hope it wont get wor	1
This is actually comfortable and not at all like my last helmet which was incredibly distracting whenever my husband and I would go out cycling.	1
We like this purchase.  Only problem occurred on road trip from St. Louis to Chicago.  When were an hour or so outside of Chicago, the unit alerted us to congested traffic.  When we punched the button to switch to an alternate route, the unit took us far away from our intended destination.	0
I love my lap desk.  The only thing is I thought I was getting the one in the picture (grey bottom) and  it arrived with a bright red bottom.<br />I can deal with it!!	0
Don't work as well as I expected.  It seems to collapse on itself and doesn't work as well as my old 98 cent plunger,  but I liked the idea that it was coated and the water runs right off the surface.	0
I ride my bike several times a week to work or for pleasure, and I like the increased softness and wider seat over the seat that came with my bike.  Prior to this I had a gel slipcover that went over my old seat.  That one was OK until it started to come apart.  The center hole adds a little more comfort as well.  The price was less expensive than our local WalMart for a similar item.  Definitely an improvement!	0
Anyone looking for monitors? The speakers are greatly balanced and the tone is awesome, voice sounds so clean...it could only get better with a board. The built in mixer does a great job, really i love them, jam with a single at home and if more people show up through on the other...the're awesome check'em out!	1
Great product that has helped me stop the dryness in my skin. I'd recommend to persons that like natural medicine over chemicals.	0
 This sounds just as good and much better price. Also,battery life is incredible. Had it powered on in backpack during hike, played playlist all night and lasted entire hike out in the morning. It outlasted 2 cell phone batteries and my ipod.	1

It says in the advert &#34;100% USDA organic&#34; but there is NO USDA ORGANIC LOGO on the PACK! The USDA labeling regulations for organic food products state clearly that the USDA organic symbol must be displayed on the pack if a product claims to be USDA certified organic. ‘Accelerated Intelligence Distribution' (the distributors of matchaDNA) also claim in the advert that the matcha is “USDA, SWISS, EU and NOP certified organic”. Again, there are no symbols or evidence on the pack to support their claim (there should be evidence on the pack)! The distributors are MISLEADING customers into thinking that the product is certified organic by two organic certification bodies. Why would you not print the symbols of the organic certification bodies when the regulations say you must? No one is above the law. I think that this is a scam. This is totally unacceptable and unlawful! This gift has to go in the bin!	1
Great value shampoo. Does not smell as strongly as other shampoos, and that's a great thing in my opinion because this thing annoys me. Also, it delivers great, my scalp skin is in better condition and I've been using this product for only 3 weeks now.	1
Overall I will say this toy has been a fail. No dogs that I have played with have found interest in it. If I throw it like a ball, sure, they will go after it. If you put food in it, yeah they show some interest in it for a while. But i have yet to see a dog play with it on its own time.	1
This stuff here was no good in my personal opinion. I didn't lose any weight at all and It certainly did not curb my appetite. I tried a different brand and had much better results though so I don't know what to make of that but that is what it is.	1
Nice piece of furniture but had a hard time putting the furniture together. Took much longer than an hour that I previously heard from the other reviewers. All in all once put together, it looks great.	1
This Moen Transitional Deck Mounted Soap Dispenser Faucet in spot resistant, brushed stainless steel is beautiful, clean looking. I used it to replace a very old, no longer used dispenser. After it was in, it really cleaned up the look of the sink area. No soap bottles! Yay!<br /><br />So, like the faucet I installed recently, the actual installation of this dispenser is a breeze. That is, AFTER you remove the old unit. I had the same problem as with the faucet: unscrewing the old rusted nut (plastic disc screw like the one that comes with this soap dispenser but with metal ring under it????). I finally got it out with a hammer/chisel combo (I can't even explain this here). But once that was out and I did a quick scrub of the opening and surface, it took less than five minutes to install. The faucet in this particular sink is not a Moen but it is brushed stainless so it matches perfectly.<br /><br />To refill, you lift up the top and pour. Each pump provides enough soap to wash a substantial number of dishes. I guess you could also use this for hand soap if you wash everything in a dishwasher.<br /><br />It's a lovely, clean-looking unit but $100+ for a soap dispenser boggles the mind. I had to remove a star for the price but really, it's most definitely a five-star product.	0
I love these! I love chocolate but am cutting back on sugar. I make a morning chocolate smoothie with these, add them to my pumpkin bread and banana bread, and cut back on chocolate chips in my chocolate chip cookies by replacing some of them with these. The flavor is outstanding and the Navitas brand always tastes very fresh.	1
I ordered this yoga mat bag for my friend (the beige one) and she received it today. She loves it! She bikes to her yoga studio and she really likes that she can put everything she needs in the bag - mat, keys, water bottle, towel, etc. It's a great design and I'm going to order one for myself now!	1
I also am getting inconsistent results! On one monitor I get a high reading and on another monitor I get a low reading (blank circle)- on the same urine sample! Both tests are exactly the same product. This is disappointing and I no longer trust the accuracy of this test.	0
This Solar fairy string lights of Warm white is Wonderful. I really love this color of the blossom. They aren't extremely bright, but they do give off a soft glow. So fun, great price & different than many of the other solar lights.	1
Once again I have a Wink girdle in every size and color possible.  They are very comfortable and we all know just having one color of girdle can restrict what we wear them with.  Thank you Wink Shapewear.	1
This is a strong purchase for iPhone 6 plus cases. because the phone is so big, cases can look so big on the phone. not this one! it is SO thin that it makes the phone look good.	1
Amazing headphones. These have such good sound quality and are great at blocking out background noise.If someone is sitting near you they may be able to hear what you're listening to if it's too loud. But that's a small complaint.Love it so much!	1
Series six rotten egg trashies are amazing!! They come hidden inside purple plastic eggs that pull apart at the side into two pieces. This series include some very fresh new and innovative designs. They pretty much all have to do with prehistoric themes. There are ancient eggs-hibits which include dino poop, boggy bonfire, and scum scorcher (also a fire character). There are scrambled animals including the very cool battered bat, puking primate, rotten tooth tiger, and soft boiled sloth to name a few. One of my favorite kinds of trashies in this series are the puke eggs. These are a clear chartreuse egg shaped outer shell with a tiny solid trashy trapped inside. These characters include a poached spider, baked bug, and waste wasp and many more. There is hard boiled trash which feature a speckled, granite like finish. There is eggs-cavated trash which look like fossilized critters stuck in a broken open rock. Some of the characters include sewer slither (a snake), soiled shrimp, oozy octopus, and runny roach. There are eggstinct trash which feature dinosaur characters. There are four limited edition trashies: slime skull, manky maggot, litter lizard, and scrambled rat. These new trash pack additions are very clever and detailed and were a serious hit with my son. Any trash pack collector will crack their shell over these!!	0
My kitten got ring worm that I needed to treat.  He was a shelter cat, so I guess this wasn't unexpected.  I got this and bathed him three times with it.  I also used a topical medicine that the vet gave me.  I decided to get this when he wasn't getting better as fast as I thought he should.  After these three baths, he was clear.  I am very pleased.	1
Everybody wants to fall for their promises. But this is a relatively unheard of brand, some even say a non existant company. Look at how amateur their labels and products are. You have to ask yourself if you would trust this kind of amateur stuff? No way! Don't waste your money.	1
I think it is very old already having super Mario everywhere. I was just shocked and surprised to see my son wearing this. And my husband too. They look so cute. Well, my son looks cute but my husband looks funny. He is too big for it.<br /><br />Well, I never thought that it will last after few washes but to my surprise, it looks great even after wash after wash after wash.<br /><br />It has great quality, that's what it shows.	1
I installed as directed. It STINKS!!!  Possibly attracted more flies, I'll give them that that part worked- but no dead flies anywhere (and one is installed in a tiled garage). Now I have a stinky garage and MORE flies.	0

I am a beginner as far as playing the violin goes, and I was advised that this should do for a beginner, though a professional music director would recommend a more highly priced one. For the price I got this one, I am comfortable and looking forward to an amazing experience with violins. This is my first one and so far so good...	1
This is such a beautiful mix of &#34;Chocolate Mud Pie Browns&#34;!!!  Some are frosted and some are metallic (reds, tans, golds and more, not just browns).  They are an absolutely beautiful mix of colors of 6/0 Czech Seed Beads in 1 ounce lots!  I am inspired by these beads, as well as am just having FUN creating with them.  They are really good quality, and I would buy them again.	0
My daughter absolutely loves this. She plays with it all the time. We have so much fun building stuff and they are big enough we don't loose them.	0
Easy to apply even if you goof up the first time.  No need to wet the screen, etc., like other products require.  I appreciate the good matte finish and really helps with the glare without too much distortion or loss of screen quality.	0
This bag holds much more than the one I had been using for many years. I can't speak to its durability at this point but if it holds up reasonably well, it will be a good value.	0
I'm really enjoying having a smaller hand held cheese grater. It's much easier to clean and use then my older stand up grater. I use this to grate cheese right on top of homemade pizza and salads instead of having to use the larger grater and a bowl or a plate. I also love that it is dishwasher safe and comes with a storage pouch so I don't cut my hands on it when it's in my utensil drawer.	1
I'm really happy with the purchase!  nice quality, The craftsmanship is perfect, fine workmanship,  the style is absolutely beautiful, when i wear it, the sunglasses is very comfortable. suggestion buy the glasses, won't be disappointed.	1
This deal is a great alternative for the apple cable that is very expensive. I actually saved a fraction on these rather than having the expensive one. Had then in my workstation and in our house for quite a few weeks now, and it works perfect every time.	1
It absorbs quickly and completely and leaves skin oh so smooooth but the smell of the lotion doesn't suite me.  I would love it if this also came in a variety pack with nice smell. I also ordered the Bay laurel foot and leg lotion and found it to be just as great. I will be ordering more of this as the weather cools.	1
I ordered this teapot to replace another glass teapot that I'd had for almost nine years.  I wanted a nice large pot because i love making big batches of herbal tea and sipping them over the course of several hours while the herbs continue to steep. I wanted to get another glass pot for both the aesthetic and the practical. It looks lovely with the tea and it is completely neutral to the flavor.  One reviewer mentioned that this pot is so large that they couldn't just make tea for two -for me that was a selling point!<br /><br />Cons: the lid, which fits perfectly when the tea is hot, is a bit loose when it's lukewarm or cold.  As with any glass teapot, if you aren't careful it will break, though this one has a nice thickness to the glass,  so it's not eggshell fragile.<br /><br />Pros: It is BIG, 1.8 liters! Almost two quarts!  The fine mesh strainer is stainless steel and is deep enough to hold enough tea/herbs to make a flavorful tea and it won't strand the tea out of the liquid after the first cup.  it's also fine enough for loose leaf peppermint tea, which fell through the previous strainer i had.<br /><br />If you drink a lot of tea,  this is one i would recommend.	0
I don't like about the product was the shape of the utensils. I have to get used to the shape and I didn't notice until after I purchased them that it doesn't come with a fork utensil. A lot odd pieces, but Very cheap quality. If I knew I wouldn't buy.	1
This is now one of my favorite love stories, reincarnation of two lovers whose love spans over lifetimes, and the villain that would keep them apart. Action, singing, dancing all the great ingredients that make Bollywood great and unique.	0
This is HORRIBLE!!! I ordered two of these gates and the first one was broken. I put the second one up and it wouldn't even open. These aren't made well and they are just really a bad product. VERY disappointed. Don't waste your time or money.	1
This thing saves me grief about postage, and it works fast and accurate. The only &#34;sort-of problem&#34; is it's small enough to set aside out-of-the-way, it can be hard to find when you want it.	0
This is pretty handy and the price is something to be celebrated as well. I can't believe that I found something this good for the price.	1
a very useful dispenser, with kids using it-not recommended without some supervision due to it being made primarily of plastic	0
After reading the reviews, i have a much better bike than i expected. For this price, it is very good purhase. I assembled it in half hour as all rear end came assembled already. Gears and brakes etc are already came installed. I had to adjust the gears and brakes easily and its ready for a ride. The rear brake cable was damaged during shipment and i contacted Kent (importer) and they confirmed shipment of a new one free.	0
Maybe it is me, but this thing as stretchy and pliable as it is was, was very tight fitting. Even with plenty of water-based lube it was literally chocking me. The concept and small palm size is great, but they need to make a larger version. I just could not seem to get a comfortable tug from it. I love most of the Doc products, but this one was very tight. It ended up tearing after a few attempts.	1
It's exactly like the picture! Great size, nice colour but! the instructions on how to pack it together wasn't clear. I had to search on google/YouTube awhile before I found out how to do it. Gonna test the tent now this weekend to see how it manage mother-nature...to be continued...	1
I just got this new Christmas tree and I was looking for the perfect lights to set of the mood in my new house and I came across these and they were perfect!!! Loved how they looked and made me feel. Their also at a surprising low price definitely a steal anybody will enjoy them!!	1
Useful trays for storing those medium-sized whatsits. The don't fit together so they go straight up and down, which is a tad annoying.  But otherwise I like how simple and robust they are.  No fiddly parts.	0
This charm is expensive, considering it did not come with a chain, which I had to purchase separately. However, my daughter loved it.  My grand daughter, was born on Mother's Day this year, so it was a really nice gift to give my daughter a few hours later! It is really pretty, and of good quality.	0
Great Book!  Small, easy to read account of an important part of history.  I'm a novice at WW2 history and my brother is an expert--we both loved it. Well made book with quality pages will last long into the future.	0
I purchased the LG Cinema Screen TV a few months ago through Amazon.  Not only did I get a great price on Amazon, the television arrived in great condition before it was even scheduled to arrive.  The picture on this TV is amazing.  We have watched several 3D Blu Ray movies on this LG TV and the 3D effects are very cool.  I recommend this TV to anyone.	0
Would not reconmend for serious painters. The 00 is not very fine.  Will be using these for terrain painting not the best for mini's.	0
Quality jacket. Great windbreaker and rain jacket. I love this. It's waterproof, but lined with net material so you get air circulation and don't over-heat wearing it. I like the velcro adjustment strips on the wristbands.  Most important is the attached hood--you can run around anywhere and not worry about an umbrella. Nice pockets Very well-made and just looks good.	1
You must read this book if you are a Christian. If you cannot be a spiritually grown person, it is no use of being a Christian. Books like this and [[ASIN:B00DQHQ4HM God, Me, and Sweet Iced Tea: Experiencing God in the Midst of Everyday Moments (Christian Spiritual Growth)]] are the best guides we have so far to show us the way to be a real, happy Christians. So every Christians must read these books.	1
I purchased the bright rose color and as the name describes and unlike the picture depicts the jacket is indeed a bright pink color. This was somewhat disappointing but still a nice jacket.	0
My sister gave this to my daughter and this is better than the other Winnie in malls. So soft and cudly!	1
High quality design and a great tool.  I also have found the DVD videos that go along with this very helpful.	0
I always love scrap booking and taking photos with friends, and this saves me the time of going to photo printing shop and have them printed. The films are quite expensive though but you can get lots of value and deals for that here in amazon.	1
I bought this for my son, who is collecting them. These Funko POP Heroes Figures are really cute. Love them.	0
We just received this puppet this week and we love it! It's easy enough for my 2 1/2 year old to manage or myself. This brand is amazing in quality and the size of their puppets. Perfect for puppet play or snuggling! We absolutely adore the Folkmanis Goat Puppet also! $30 is a perfect price for this, I would not pay the original pricing on this $47. If that is the only option I would get the goat or wait until the price changes. Depends on how important it is to you and your collection though.	0
I purchased this dog collar for three of my dogs that I love a lot, but they bark terribly especially at night time. It was getting to the point that I wouldn't be able to get to sleep at night time so I had to do something about it. My good friend advised that I get a no bark collar, so I looked for online for one and discovered this one. This collar is effective, and until now I have no motive to think it has any negative side effects on my dogs. I can basically count the quantity of times they bark per night time now...if they even do! Thank you so much, because now I can rally sleep and wake up rested every morning!	1
Super cool controller for playing at night time. So much fun and it works all the same as the normal one.	1
I can tell you that from now on I will have Hershey's Bars on hand for snacking on, and for various recipes. I'll use them in cakes, brownies, trifle. I find it melts well for dipping, (fruit slices).	1
Had to send the first one back. The release mechanism was defective. No hassle returns policy, ordered the second one, but had to settle for another color...OK, the new one worked fine. Great size.	1
The box is too small for my cat (a domestic long hair, about 10 lbs). He often misses the box completely and we have to clean up after him. The box is flimsy, my cat doesn't even use the step (which is the whole selling point of this box), and when he digs through the litter, the sides are low enough that the litter just flies out of the box. I do like the color of the box, at least...	0
Wow....I received this jacket as a birthday gift. Best jacket I have ever owned by far!!!<br />I like it.  fits me exactly and comfortable to wear. recommend it.	1
These are very shiny and sturdy and great on my charm bracelet for a great price. They shipped really quickly and arrived secure in bubble wrap. I'm very happy with my purchase.	0
Can't beat the price. Good quality and sounds great. I'm really enjoying it. Perfect guitar for a starter.	1
This is a very user friendly camera. Love that I just take the card out and plug it to my computer to download. It is very handy.	1
Perfect companion with the &#34;Headset Buddy Gold Plated 2.5mm to 3.5mm Adapter for iPhone, iPad, Android, Blackberry&#34;<br />It helps you  - Convert 2.5mm Headset to 3.5mm Jack (01-PH25-PH35G)	0
My son found his goggles uncomfortable and they would annoy him and one of the other mums mentioned this product and how it was much easier.  He tried on the goggles with this replacement strap and loved the simplicity of the strap.  Needless to say for his next lesson we used the new strap and no more annoying goggles.	1
This is quite an eye opener. Liz was this kind of lady, was she? I heard rumors, but wow. If this isn’t true though, then this is one slanderous piece.	1
We bought the large size for our very docile and well behaved standard poodle and gave it a test run while we went to church.  We came home an hour later and found her out, and when we investigated the crate we realized she must have put pressure on the zipper and unzipped it.  We took a luggage lock and locked the two zippers together, and went out for another short trip.  We came home and found her out again, only this time she pushed hard enough against the door to rip the zipper out at the seam.<br /><br />We returned the damaged crate (Amazon refunded us) and went with a sturdier plastic crate with metal bar door.  I loved the looks of this and I'm sad it didn't work!  I think any dog, no matter what size, is going to look at this crate as a challenge and work to get out of it.	0
Purchased this for my 2 year old daughter and she is glad to pay with this. It is soft and also attractive! Made with premium quality and lasts even after rough usage.	1
Previously I had to buy this brow pencil from a make-up artist. I'm so glad Amazon carries it. This pencil is soft and a bit powder-y so it applies for a natural look.  Many brow pencils are too waxy; this one isn't.  I buy dark taupe and soft taupe and blend them.  I use this product every day to fill in and extend my brow line. I've tried many brow pencils but this is the best.	0
If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.<br /><br />Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?<br /><br />In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.<br /><br />In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.<br /><br />This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.	0
This is an exceptional little light. I like that it has four settings, has a rechargeable battery, and is very east to carry around or hang in a closet. I have mine hanging in a hall closet that doesn't get much light from the hallway light, and this thing lights it up very well. The highest regular setting is more than adequate to provide very bright light where needed. The lower setting also give out a good amount of light for smaller areas.<br /><br />This will be a great light to have when power goes out, or for times you just need more light for projects around the house. I am very pleased with this purchase and plan to get a few more to have on hand for when there are power outages. Definitely recommend this!	1
I like the color and the size is okay for the price. The subtle metallic sparkle is a nice touch. Speaking of touch it feels good on bare feet. Adds coziness and style. If it had padding on the bottom I'd give it 5 stars, but know that it was slip all around on the floor without carpet tape.	1
This watch is stunning. My wife absolutely loved it. MAKE SURE to look at the specs in the description, however. The face is much smaller than it seems in the picture.	1
I'm going to warn everyone that the price if only for one chair when it came to me it was fine but after 3 days 2 legs got broke even the material they use is very low quality and cheap finishing is also not good.	1
this is exactly what we needed. This bag is roomy, it easily fits my boots.  I can also pack a  helmet, goggles, gloves & a neck gaiter in the center compartment. When we travel (we live in Colorado so drive to the mountains for the weekend) it also accommodates my ski pants and jacket in the center compartment. In addition, if we are going multi-day, I pack extra base layers and socks in the bag. I keep ski passes, hand warmers, multi-tool & extra foot beds in the outer pockets. If you are looking for a compact bag with just room for the essentials, this is not your bag. If you are looking for a bag that you can pack all your ski gear (with the exception of skis/snowboard) for travel this is your bag.<br /><br />The materials seem sturdy enough, though we'll see with repeated use how this holds up.	0
it is defective - the zipper pull is not good, the tab comes off --<br />piece of junk and I want to send it back!<br />Awful	0
My sister loved this hankies terribly. She was even asking me where I got them from and I told her and she said that she's going to buy another box.	1
I was very sceptical on buying this, but once i hooked everything up and did a load of wights with no bleach or detergent and saw how white they were i was glad i bought it! Very bright whites and colors all with no soap and all cold water! Would recommend this to everyone.	0
I kept buying cheap springform pans and they rusted and leaked. These are pricey but so well worth it. I make a delicious cheesecake in this new pan and it turned out with no cracks and the pan did not leak.	0
Very easy to install, and works well. We keep the magnet "key" on the kitchen light switch above the lower cabinets. Works well!	1
This pendant is very pretty and looks all the same to the pictures.The color of the flower is rich and shiny, that makes the rose a unique and vivid look. I really like this red rose pendant.And I find they have this kind of earrings from their images, but no this earrings in this ads. I want to buy that too. Looks really beautifull.Maybe I can contact with the seller about that.	1
The potency of this supplement is certainly unheard of among people I know. Usually, it takes months before anything happens, but within a few weeks, the difference in my weight and health became very clear.	1
Perfect for backpacking or camping in any weather, I also use this in our living room when I watch T.V. and the temperature gets low.  The material is great and it feels really comfortable.	1
A staple ingredient for one of our popular new herb blends. Just the right amount of fresh celery taste!	0
If you like music games and have a PS3 this is great choice. I enjoy playing this and it is relatively family friendly rated.	1
The table was received quickly. It was easy to put together with the allen wrench provided and a phillips screwdriver. The table is very sturdy and looks wonderful. An excellent buy for the price.	1
These earrings are so great.<br />Very simple and very sturdy earrings.<br />I'm so very comfortable with these and for the price?-- u can't beat it!	1
Although this bassinet is sometimes billed as a safe alternative to co-sleeping, it's also just a fabulous option for mainstreamers. Breastfeeding is wonderful, but it's also hard work - anything you can do to make it more convenient for mom is a great thing!<br /><br />I bought this for use with my newborn son.  To me, wanting to keep him close at night was very instinctive, but I wanted to ensure a safe way of doing it and a way that would eventually facilitate an easy-ish transition to crib sleeping.<br /><br />I especially wanted to be able to have easy access to him during the night so that he could nurse. This bassinet makes nighttime nursing as unobtrusive as possible. I hear my son as he wakes up and begins lightly fussing, and can get him out before he can escalate to crying.  I grab him, nurse him, and put him back to bed without really waking up at this point (extremely helpful when he decides to nurse nearly every hour because of a growth spurt!). I can easily see if he's making noises in his sleep versus awake and fussing - saves me a trip out of bed. The close proximity also gave me peace of mind in the beginning because I could check his breathing!<br /><br />We have two dogs who sleep on my husband's side of the bed; the co-sleeper makes me feel like my baby is separate from them and safe (they're great dogs, but I prefer to err on the side of caution).<br /><br />We use the leg extenders, which do as they say. They do make it slightly less stable, but I feel totally confident that the construction is solid. The wheels on one end are a nice touch.<br /><br />When setting up the bassinet, be sure to step down hard on all the sides - they're stiff and can easily be mistaken for locked when they're not.<br /><br />This bassinet does not collapse easily. We didn't buy it for that purpose, but it's still of note. I tried to collapse it for the first time last week to go to my parents' house and I felt like I was wrestling a bear! I had to watch a video online to get an idea of how to even do it. I'm hopeful that it might get easier the more I do it.<br /><br />The mattress is definitely hard, but it's supposed to be. My little guy doesn't seem to mind!<br /><br />It's handy that there are pockets on each end and I love the large storage compartment underneath. We keep extra sheets, extra leg extenders, an extra boppy cover, and more in there and there's tons of room to spare.<br /><br />I like the tan dot, it blends into our room and doesn't seem to take up a lot of space.<br /><br />Overall, a great option for babies and for saving parents getting out of bed repeatedly to get a baby when they're exhausted. Will continue to use this with my son until he grows out of it and plan to save it in hopes of baby number 2 in a few years.	0
Nice flash, easy to operate, works well with my Nikon d3000, batteries last long enough and the charger works well	0
There are not words for how much I love this! My kids love having these in the house and they go crazy for them. Best Chanukkah presents ever! Inexpensive and endless entertainment for my squirrley, wintertime kids.	0
Got this to replace the aging headband on my [[ASIN:B0006NL5SM Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 250 ohms]]. It does this just fine, in good style comparable to the original.  Pros: * Look is very similar to the original (one more snap, same color) * Fit is a tiny bit tight, but it does go on OK * Length is perfect * The cushioning is nice; I don't feel the headphones' weight up there at all  Cons: * The material feels delicate, like it'll probably wear out faster than the original; time will tell * The underside material (what contacts the metal band) is not nearly as durable as the material in the original, which is quite tough. This may never become an issue, but given how the DT 770's adjustment never stays put, this could manifest in some internal tears.  Other thoughts: * For the price, a nice replacement headband. I'll update periodically as it ages to note how it has performed. So far so good.  Followup: Nine months in, and I'm upping to 5-star because it's lasting, taking normal use and minor abuse like falling prey to cat shenanigans. No rips and tears, still soft.  Followup -- Oct 2015: still going strong, no tears, no snags. I am impressed and have amended my earlier concerns about not being heavy-duty. It has taken daily use for quite a while, and hasn't shredded.	0
It took a while for us to get into this but when we did it was really funny.  The second time is a charm.	0
The taste of these nuts is very good, and the price was amazing I thought for this type of product, except, you do get what you pay for. The very expensive candied pecans are always whole pieces of nuts, these are about 50% tiny pieces, but as I said the taste is good. Just not for serving company.	0
The screen protector applied easily, but it is not holding up well against fingerprints and looks dirty and oily in only 4 days of use. I received them March 28th and today is April 2nd.	0
Had to get these for the novelty.  They honestly smell like an empty beer can, not totally appetizing, but the smell is dead on.  The important part, the taste, is pretty darn good and I kept eating them so that's a good sign.<br /><br />The aftertaste reminds me a little of Heineken.  The look is a little creepy as well, I don't want to know what they use to get that copper-metallic color into these things.	0
Sort of big and bulky for my tiny wrist, but it was a great deal and it looks good and runs fine so far.	0
Odd, my soldering iron stopped working suddenly.  The tip looked fine and I checked to ensure it was snug.  On a whim, I ordered these replacement tips and installed one in the non-functioning iron.  Boy! Did that soldering iron come back to life quickly.  My lesson is to not assume the soldering tip is ok based on visual appearance alone.	0
I love the fit and the sound quality. It doesn't come loose or wiggle once in place. I'll get this one again!	0
Other than [[ASIN:B008DZJWXA JS Sensor Kit - Arduino Compatible]] this is my most favorite Arduino sensor kit. This is more useful if you have enough knowledge about these things. Specially electronics.	1
This thing works great. After a while you don't even notice it, but its there, watching, just in case. The mount also works great and has never fallen from the windshield. I don't think you can beat the features packed into this camera at this crazy price<br /><br />Loving it so far, does what it is advertised to do.<br />This camera takes full 1080p 30fps video which has surprisingly amazing quality and resolution when put on a computer or TV even compared to higher end cameras.<br />I like the capacitor model because there is no cheapo battery to go bad. So far the camera has held up in some extreme heat and direct sun with no issues.<br /><br />Good picture quality, records well and clear. Easy to use. I leave it up all the time in direct sunlight and it still functions normally. I read around before purchasing and this model seemed to be the best. Vision at night is ok but you can only really see what your headlights light up. I thought the screen was supposed to time out and cut off after a couple of minutes but that may have been another cam I was looking at while shopping around. It's not too bright to be a distraction though. The mount is good enough to set it and forget it but may be a problem if your constantly removing and replacing and not gentle. I give it 5 Stars. I'm satisfied. Still have not took it down. Works every time.	1
Overkill--akin to protection for kids' tablets: That's exactly what's desired here by many. Beware: The purchaser may obtain exactly what they wish to obtain! Proximity sensor for  Kingpad K70 is covered--area at top of this needs tedious cutting out of the thick rubberized material--with scissors or an exacto/box cutter knife: Not an exact fit for K70, yet workable. Universal fit for many PRC-branded 7&#34; tabs. Cutout for USB and mini-HDMI exists, also.<br /><br />I protect the tab further with a screen protector and by putting everything everything into an old durable heavy synth-fabric zipper case, as well. Extreme rubberizing makes this product far heavier and bulkier than it may prove otherwise. Provides great protection--until I find something more suitable. May make pocketing, or even purse usage, somewhat more difficult.<br /><br />I'd prefer something thinner-skinned, also rubberized, which hugs the tablet better: This also is a little loose--never to the point at which the tab ever falls out, though. Somewhat difficult to remove the tab--no biggie. Material is so heavy, pulling it outward in order to remove the tab may prove a little more difficult than need be otherwise--no biggie. (It truly is thick and heavily rubberized--never rigid. It's &#34;springy&#34;--a very good thing.)<br /><br />This makes 7&#34; tabs somewhat more unwieldy, heavy, and bulky--even than before--not a good thing. Inducing further clumsiness, this even makes dropping the tab somewhat more likely. It should protect very well then, though--given that the screen doesn't hit something. Pushing buttons isn't as &#34;tactile&#34; as with thinner-skinned products. (The key moldings for such buttons do exist, though.)<br /><br />Maybe I'll leave &#34;skinning&#34; at this, in the end. Somewhat ambivalent, I feel very confident while handling the tab in its protection. A very safe bet for value 7&#34; tabs, with mini-HDMI.....	0
Great fence, made well. This is definitely not made for beginners, this thing was annoying to put together. You will need a few people to help with fencing.	0
I ordered this urn and the 10&#34; one. Not really sure what happened with this one. The cap does not screw on and I had to glue it on to keep it on. Obviously this means it cant be opened again - not that I'd need to	0
Works great, save some time read directions, install battery first, then connect wires, no more annoying beeping and ready for winter storms.	1
I bought this for my daughters 3rd birthday. She loves acting like me in the morning when I am getting ready for work and she is doing her hair as I am and it is absolutely the cutest thing ever. Also in the evening when we get home she always wants me to sit in front of the set and work on my hair and she can do that all day if I allowed her too. This has been one really stable product and I have no issues, it was easy putting it together and she has put it to the test and trust me it is very well made.	1
Got what I paid for.  I don't really need an expensive pair just to pull off an 80's look.  This one was enough.  I's poorly made, they are plastic lenses.  But affordable	1
This chocolate is very good, I was looking for a good one that met my expectations. I use it for milkshakes made ​​with banana and chocolate is all, is delicious and healthy . I am ready to make a delicious cake and I'm sure that I stay tasty and the best I can control the sugar. I love eating healthy and as natural as possible for my health and my family. And the best that I can make healthy desserts, rich , easy and fast .	1
this is definitely one of the best games out there, i had bought this for my son and he enjoys it, even I wanna play it sometimes, he owns all the Super Mario games and i think i made the best decision when i bought it. the quality of the graphics is good, we can't complain because you have to be reasonable that the system is from years ago and is still one of the classics so for me it is good.<br /><br />no matter the amount of cables is has around i like it very much and the controllers are simple but not ugly or uncomfortable. i think the mario games are the best because he just doesn't stop playing them.<br /><br />if you have never experienced this console you haven't lived yet. i highly recommend it.	1
I was so nervous about ordering furniture online. I am so pleased with this item. It goes so well with my 40 yr old bedroom set, you'd think it came together. It came much faster than expected also.	1
The stand that the TV was sitting on was a bit short.  This helped put it where it needed to be, and is great because it swivels.  Everyone in the room can see now.	0
First off, my popcorn popper uses oil... one of those where you put olive oil in the pan, put in popcorn kernels, put on the cover, plug it in... and when it stops popping, you put a lid on the cover thing, flip it over, and you have a serving bowl.<br /><br />There is not a lot of oil, but usually some moisture...  so unlike many of the other reviews I've seen, the seasoning did stick to the popcorn fairly well.<br /><br />I liked the cheese flavored choices, but didn't really like the sweet ones (caramel, kettle corn).<br /><br />I don't love the ingredient lists with stuff I cannot identify.<br /><br />But...<br /><br />These make it fun for my kids to eat popcorn, and there certainly are worse choices out there.  I also like the non-sweet ones on hard boiled eggs, potatoes, broccoli,  and anything else I've tried.<br /><br />I like the idea of the mini jars, as I was surprised at which I didn't love (I thought I'd love the caramel) and which I liked.  The size is also really nice to throw in the kids' backpack for camping trips, as they tend to end up with hard-boiled eggs when they are backpacking, and this little container certainly makes those more appealing too.<br /><br />I need to figure out a way to use the sweet ones, though.	0
This charger works great! Great quality and also in affordable price. Shipped in timely manner. Love it. highly recommended.	1
I don't read very often, but after picking up the book, I couldn't put it down. Great book for all ages.	1
Went together easily. Good quality for price. I needed to hide some exercise equipment in an otherwise nicely furnished room. It's doing the job.	0
Bought this for my son.He's certainly enjoying these lenses very much.Coated lenses, nicely finishes aluminum housing, easy to us.The magnetic rings stick on the phone firmly.Easy and light to carry around.Good value for money	1
Very happy with this purchase.  Regular oatmeal is easy enough to make but this is faster, neater, and easy to bring to work.	0
This proved useful for when I have to stay inside & get some work done in my home office, and my 7yr old son is playing elsewhere in the house or outside.<br /><br />It's a pricey item, but considering that you can use it for so much more than baby monitoring, I think it's a good investment.	0
We really loved our purchase! We ordered the king size bed, bought it on a Sunday and the item arrived on Tuesday 3 days earlier than what amazon expected delivery! It was huge and heavy, the bed went to life immediately after we pulled off the vacuum plastic wrap, we let it sit the whole day and by the end of the day it has pretty much reached its max expansion, 14 inch is really thick, I'm glad we went for the that size for I wanted a really high bed almost to my hip level.  Five days past still has some smell on it but not noticeable and noxious. Over all the bed is a bargain, but the quality is excellent. Lets just hope that it holds true for years to come. Happy sleeping!	0
This planner is very bulky, but it serves its purpose well. However, I would suggest going with something smaller if you plan on carrying it in your purse.	0
Sensor is not sensitive enough and the plastic bottom came apart with the aluminum case when i tried to take out the bulb.It is very dangerous i can actually see the wires.	1
This book seems like a half-hearted attempt to do that. It's not a chronology. Basically it's just Bourdain's random thoughts on a number of subjects that don't appear to be at all related. Some of the chapters are typical Bourdain - ranting, profane, entertaining. Others are just boring.	1
I have found the Hayward filter cartridge to be sturdier and more effectively cleaned (i.e. cleanings result in a reduced filter tank gauge pressure which indicates a higher water flow rate and better overall pool cleaning characteristics)than Unicel filters. So for a pool which is very susceptable to a lot of debris, this filter makes a lot of sense and I recommend it to my customers despite its higher cost. However, for folks with screened pools, little debris intrusion, and a more frugal budget, I recommend the Unicel, Pleatco or Waterway cartridge replacement.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you've got an extra $20-$50 or have a pool susceptable to large amounts of debris, get the genuine hayward catridge.	0
I travel often and now that I am packing for two (me and my baby) these packing cubes are very handy! Now I don't have to section out parts of my suitcase for me or for baby. With the packing cubes I can put all my babies different items in the cubes and grab them when I need them! These are very helpful when trying to be and stay organized while away from home. These have allowed me to pack more, and to pack smarter. I highly suggest these to frequent travelers and those with children. Now that we are home, we use these in the car to hold the extra baby items- extra change of clothes, blanket, extra diapers, ect.	1
I love this bedding, only problem was the mobile we received with it was messed up and corroded! Was not happy because now we can't use it or return it. Thought the quality could have been a little bit better. Also, it only came with one window valace, most rooms have two windows do they not?	1
Pretty sturdy and light weight, does most of the supporting for any size DSLR with a kit lens. If u need to use a tripod in windy conditions this is not it. But for any indoor and calm weather use its perfect. Easy to carry around too that ensures you actually use it!	1

We bought this as a Christmas/Birthday gift to my godchild. We were expecting a bigger pendant of Elsa's face but it turns out that it's smaller than we expected. The necklace is less than attractive as I've imagined it. Good thing is that most of the little girls now loves Elsa so, no matter what design the necklace is, as long as they have Elsa in their pendant, they'll love it no matter what. Good job on putting Elsa's face by the way.	1
Doctor King's organic Japanese matcha is fresh, green, smells great and tastes very good. For anyone that is new to matcha, here are a couple of my favorite matcha recipes.  To make a matcha latte, I sift one teaspoon or two grams of matcha onto 8 oz of hot milk (160 F). I blend the matcha and milk with a hand blender and pour it into a latte glass. Sift a little matcha on top. Lovely! It has a light bright green color and is delicious! Sometimes I make matcha tea with this matcha - it's quite nice. Unlike some others brands I've tried, Doctor King's matcha is not bitter.  I love smoothies. Here is how I make a Matcha Super Smoothie. I use organic vegetables and fruit. I put a handful of organic spinach, one stick of celery. some cucumber, water 4 oz, ice 4 oz, organic Japanese matcha 1/2 teaspoon, one kiwi fruit, one pear, one apple and a couple of berries into a blender. Blend until smooth. Serve in a glass. I say &#34;drink it and feel super!&#34;  I have taken a few pics. I took the pics in a glass in bright lighting. I find that if you look at the matcha in a darker part of the kitchen or in a mug, you don't see the color so well. This product is a very good buy. It is definitely worth trying! :)	1
Comfortable, supportive, great walking shoes for and every day shoes. I can wear them without socks. I love them and will buy another pair.	0
I ordered this for my daughter for a play she was in. The quality is nice and it stood up well to lots of abuse on stage! The fit was good and true to size.	0
One wonderful aspect of this tummy tucking belt is that it can be used by both men and women and comes in a free size..thus my whole family can use it now.	1
The bowls look just like the picture and zip up so they are one compact little package. The only thing I would say is that they are pretty deep and narrow so they might be kind of difficult for a short nose breed like mine to use, but overall I think they would work just fine.	1
I was faccing problem for my acees fat at my back and arms from a long time. Then i heard about the Big Mike's Fitness Ab Slider from a friend who also use it got a good result from it. After using it i was just surprised to see the change on my own body. Its really gave me a good result whic i wanted from a long time. And now i think it was a good purchase and really happy with it.	1
I simply love the quick service this company, Longevity provides. The welding machine was delivered to me in like no time. Hats off guys!!! Did I mention how cool this little machine is? Guys, if you love machines I'm sure you will definitely fall for this one. It's quite handy and uses very less power. Comes with a pre-fitted wire and works like anything. Its pretty safe to use. Has got an overload protection. I haven't seen it getting conked off yet in spite of the long duration of continuous running. Loving it!	1
I have only used it once but I think it is great and looking forward to getting my little dogs out in it this summer.	0
These are nice and sturdy with plenty of room for writing.  The face is the same as other tags; a writing card with a medium weight plastic shield.  I couldn't quite figure out how to use the fastener straps they came with so I easily removed them and used other straps I had at home.  For the price you get enough to label all your luggage and, in these days, if you are carrying more than 5 pieces when you travel, I feel sorry for your pocketbook (smile).	0
Got 3 Garnier Nutritioniste Ultra-lift Intensive w/Retinal + Pro Elastin (newer version) from A & B Wholesale instead of the Garnier Nutritioniste Pro w/Pro-xylane, Vitamin A, Omega 3-6 (older version) which was advertised/pictured which I love. Disappointed & due not want to spend more on shipping back so will try give to family or friends that can tolerate retinal w/out redness inflammation when waking up. When wanting only Garnier Nuritioniste Pro instead of the intentive can be pretty tricky due to they both boxes almost look the same unless you know what your buying or put them next to each other then you will notice the difference. Looks like in the future I need to email/contact seller to make sure it's the one I want just to be safe. =(	0
my opinion ukulele is suitable for adults and children, it's an instrument not only nice to learn. I like the color.It has four nylon strings that can protect children's finger being scratched instead of steel strings. It's compact size and authentic acoustic tone gives them a portable and timely performance characteristics, it is very suitable for the evening campfire, roadshow or any other similar occasions. I think anybody that purchases this would love it.The tuner works nicely--because this is a nylon stringed instrument,The painted fingerboards have accurately spaced, smooth and polished frets, while the guitar-style, geared tuners are more accurate than planetary-style tuners; effectively taking the guesswork out of tuning.<br />This product is amazing i will give 5 star.	1
The book was outstadig for a sad time in our family!!  I would said the book again if there ws a need,	0
Great looking watch at a great price! Really stylish watch. Comfortable. You WILL get compliments.  displays are easy to read, on the light function works terrific. alarm etc.  I love it. Can withstand water . I would buy again.	1
I love this product for several reasons.<br /><br />First, it is multi-functional. It's a charger and a data cable.  It allows me to put in on charge and not get the annoying pop up and when you switch to USB mode, you can transfer you pics, music, files, downloads to your laptop or pc.<br /><br />If your USB and charger still works this is a convenient spare. I travel a lot so i just keep this in my travel  bag and im always prepared. We've all had a cable or two missing when you actually need them.  and for $6 dollars you can not worry about that.<br /><br />This cable is compatible with any brand of computer or laptop. You don't have to worry about getting gadgets of the same brand.<br /><br />The benefits outweigh the price of this charger/usb cable.	1
I used several of these items (1 per 1 gallon mylar bag).  They did not absorb the oxygen at all.  I've used other products that worked much better.  I did not request a refund because it is not worth my time to package the items up, and have to take them to a UPS location.	0
I have only had it for a month or so, so this review is pre-mature.The appearance is nice because it is a matte (not shiny) texture, and looks sleek. Fits well in my family room. In addition, the seat feel is firm and comfortable, it is not a soggy feel. I would say comfortable. Shipping was OK, a lot of wrapping/cardboard to remove of course. I had some issues with difficulty peeling a protective tape from the shiny feet, in fact I was not able to get all of it off but it looks fine now. Kind of expensive but I think it's probably a fair price for a large leather sofa. time will tell-  I will update this review if I have any problems with the sofa.	0
I got one to try,and let me say this combination 18 inch sub combined with the 15 inch sub in a 3/4 inch thick carpeted tower cabinet sound awesome.and for the prime free shipping no one can match then add the quick shipping in,i don't know how amazon pulls it off.

Nothing much to say. A very interesting birthday card to gift to your fellow friend! This will surely make them laugh! The very well written birthday card inside made my friend feel really excited. The picture outside of it is very well drawn and overall very pleasant to look at, which makes it very appealing! Very cheap and definitely worth it's price!	1
This paperweight is not only useful, it is also attractive. I got in this in one paperweight all those that I wanted. This one has both elegance and simplicity. My desk became even more nice-looking because of this paperweight. I am very impressed with this one. You should try this too!	1
Great practice amp.  You get a lot of features and technology for the money, plus it sounds pretty good for 20watt SS combo!	0
This is a great tool. The glue stick melts very quickly and does not require to be pushed down like my old glue gun. It goes down smoothly in itself, making me finish my craft a hell lot faster!!!	1
....and a pleasure to write with!<br />I have repeatedly ordered them and now I have received one that fails to work after a couple of days.<br />It is strangely all stuck, therefore I am quite disappointed!	0
I installed this product cause I heard that this is what I needed. I bought it off of their website. It worked at first but then stopped working. Then this ridiculous seller told me that I probably damaged it somehow when I was trying to figure out what went wrong and said I would have to purchase a new one. Do not buy from him! he does not stand behind his product.<br /><br />On top of this, the product was oozing some weird glue stuff out of it which should have tipped me off that it was an inferior product. I would never recommend this crappy seller to anyone. I hope anyone else reading this will learn from my mistake and not purchase this!	1
This case is very high quality and doesn't feel cheap at all. It's great for the price.<br />The color is very pretty and not too deep like i was thinking.<br />Highly recommend this product!!!!!	1
this new testament has easy to read print because it is from 1982 the nkjv bibles put out over the last 10 years are harder to read because the print keeps getting smaller every time Thomas nelson puts out a new bible the print gets smaller	0
You can raise a child. This product is a product that is highly recommended for parents like me. For what it is worth every penny we pay the price at all. Keep your home from pests gives a cool breeze came in very satisfactory. I should buy one more. Thank you	1
I listen to the podcast and really enjoy the suggestions and the humor. Johanna Benal has a great way to present information in a concise and direct way, while getting to the most useful parts of training.  I am really enjoying this book and would highly recommend it.	0
This was great, my only issue is that the retainers are a bit short, but I will recommend the product, the packaging is a bit much though.	0
GIAC Certified Intrusion Analyst Certification (GCIA) won't help you pass..but may ensure you fail.<br /><br />How so?  Over 50% of the info in this book is not current.<br /><br />So you will study and prep for the wrong questions.	1
I had originally bought this as a collectors item, but decided to try it after I had it a while, once I opened it, the rechargeable battery built in wouldn't take a charge.  It was too long after I purchased it to return for a different one.	0
I am soooooooo happy I came across this eye gel! I love it!!!! You can feel the difference after one application! Thank you so much OZ Naturals!! If you are looking for a new eye gel this is your product!! Highly Recommended!!!	1
Much too small for a man's arm.  These barely fit my 5' 3&#34; petite wife who weighs 109 pounds.  I can barely manage to pull them past my elbow and it is bordering on pain even with my arm outstretched, let alone when I bend my elbow.  I am extremely disappointed in the size.  I don't know if this material shrinks in the wash, but if it does, even my wife will have trouble with it. I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 185 pounds and not so much of it is fat. My BMI is 25.<br /><br />I will have to keep looking for a long arm length sleeve that I can wear outdoors while wearing a short sleeved shirt. I thought this one had the best potential, but obviously not.  I want it primarily to prevent sunburn while driving and doing yard work or playing tennis. I am open to referrals for a bigger size.	0
This is a very comfortable skirt. It fits as expected. The only thing I'm not crazy about is the fold over waist band causes the tag on the back to kind of scratch me. It's something that I can live with though and I will continue to get good use of the skirt.	0
This is a really nice mortar and pestle for grinding up vitamin tablets for my dogs.  I add it to a small dish with water, schlunk it up in the correct amount for each of five doglets, and shoosh it down their gullets in a small syringe without a needle.  Slick.<br /><br />Thanks for a wonderful product that pulverizes the pills to make them easily soluble.<br />Beautiful little item.<br /><br />nancy morse	0
The closure part broke before I got a chance to wear them. I received the earrings and very soon they broke. It is very hard to open the closing hook Not worth the fee to return them. My loss!	1
Saving to be a special Christmas present for my five year old. We love Gina and hard to find good toys for her. I think she love it. Very pretty with good detail.	1
The delivery time, first off, was very fast and this was surprising that this is a product not directly sold from Amazon, so that's my first plus point of the product! Next, the type of product that it is isn't like a normal one, it is more of a romantic and slightly vintage feel which I personally love especially how the patterns were like on the side and on the bra part.	1
A sad farewell to the original. A grand entrance for Junior. Fine performances for all...especially from Momoko Kochi, in her final film appearance, as Emiko Yamane, a role she created in the original 1954 film.	0
First, it's a great product and looks and feels just right.  The only issue I have is that it's severly over priced...not Amazon's fault, that's just the price everywhere.  In fact, Amazon was the cheapest.  We needed a pick axe to complete my son's Steve costume and with little time, got this one.  With time, I highly suggest making one yourself.  There are instructions all over the net.	0
This product is in good condition and came with a packaging. But it's not what I expected. When I saw the product picture and description, I thought and expected the inside has a full-gusseted interior, but it's not. So it was disappointed to me. It will be great to also include an inside image of this product, so customer will know how does the inside look like.	1
It is a must with the car caddy, the blur lighted M is not too bright and is pleasing. The cord is long enough to go from window to cigerttee lighter without being stretched. I do wish there is a way to get just the round disk for dash mounting, so I could try it a couple of other places, of course as long as it doesn't cost a whole lot.	0
Really good soap. But shipping package comes in the shape different from advertised picture. The picture has bottle cap. The shipment came with pump. Pump is weak and broken. Leaking contents within the package. Nevertheless, really great soap for really reasonable price. The soap also smells great. Shipping came with reasonable protection, but the pump made everything weak. A bottle cap for shipment and pump on the side for usage would have made it perfect. But Too late now.	0
the positives, it started up easy, handles great, and can take on snow like a champ.  I have used it all winter in snow from 3-4 inches to 8-11 inches and it is only a matter of taking your time with the deep snow.<br /><br />the negatives, I already lost the bolt that attached to the discharge chute to adjust the height of the spray.  Had to put a bolt i had laying around with some washer in its place to be able to adjust, and this time I put blue loctite on it so it does not go anywhere.  be sure you check the tightness of some of the bolts occasionally or use loctite when putting it together,  Another negative, I assume this is not specific to this make/model, but I used it in 9 inches of snow for 90 minutes, then let my neighbor clear their driveway, and after 90 minutes of them using he returned it saying that the augurs froze.  So I guess I am saying, don't use it in deep snow for an extended period of time because it is possible you will freeze up the fan and augurs, now I need to try to defrost is to be sure that is the real problem and not anything more serious.<br /><br />Overall, it is great, buy it.	0
very easy to set up and hang simple to use, looks great with my posters in it. and the price is right	0
I replaced a Corsair 500R with this case and I'm glad I did. I originally replaced the 500R because it just felt cheaply made and it wasn't that great to build in. The 550D has a very solid build quality and I haven't had a single issue with it since I bought it around 6 months or so ago.<br /><br />I love the magnetic dust filters on the side and top of the case and they do a very good job catching most of the dust and keeping the inside of your case relatively dust free. The bottom dust filter is good but mine has started to bend a little causing it to be slightly warped at the back of the case. Although the dust filters work great they are stating to get hard to clean. No matter if I spray them with air or wash them in the sink they still look dusty all the time. It doesn't effect them working but it does make your computer look dirty all the time.<br /><br />The cable management is pretty good on this case but I would have like more places to tie cables down on the top behind the motherboard tray. I also would've liked if the motherboard tray was raised slightly more in order to run cables behind the motherboard better. I was only able to run 4 cables behind the motherboard before there just wasn't anymore space and I couldn't screw the motherboard down. I would fully recommend getting a fully modular power supply to make building in the 550D easier. You may have issues getting the back door to fully close with all the extra connectors you're not using.<br /><br />I know all Corsair cases are made for the H100 cooler but I had a hell of a time installing the H100 in this case. The problem I had was there was barely enough space at the top between the motherboard and the radiator to clear my motherboard power connector. So right now the fans on the H100 are sitting right on top of my power connector pushing it down slightly. Other people may not have the same issue depending on where the connector sits on their motherboard. If you have one on the top of your motherboard be warned that it will be a tight fit.<br /><br />Lastly the main reason why people will buy this case, the sound dampening foam. In my experience, it doesn't do much of anything to quiet your computer down. I've tried with the side and top panels off and on and I noticed no difference in sound but obviously a lot higher temperatures with the panels on. The main reason I think it doesn't work is the foam is way too thin in order to stop enough sound to notice a difference. I feel as though they should just remove the foam all together from the 550D and sell it for a little cheaper.<br /><br />Overall the 550D is a very nice case once you look past the few annoyances it has. I've owned several cases before buying this one and so far this has been the best case I owned. I think for its price point Corsair makes some of the best looking and best made cases around. There's little doubt in my mind I'd ever consider buying another brand of case in the future unless other companies really step their game up as far as build quality.	0
Nice product.  Our son is taking this to college with him and it fit everything that he needed for the field.	0
[[VIDEOID:e69353dba5885c9c0230bbd179014b6f]]This us a clip light with 4 settings, the light it produces is not very bright.  I used a lux meter to help demonstrate the brightness of the light:    white light / bright setting = 344 lux  white light / low light setting = 162 lux    warm light / bright setting = 104 lux  warm light / low light setting = 66 lux    For comparison,  a 60 watt fluorescent light at the same distance is 1701 lux    The clip of this light is quite large, it is not something you would clip to the book as it would cover too much of the page. I found the clip a little stiff stiff and difficult to open, hopefully it will get easier as I use it.  I am using it clipped to a shelf.  My favorite feature is a nice switch on the cord that allows me to control the four light modes.  The neck is flexible and holds its position well.  It comes with a cord and USB adapter.    This clip light is provided by Mudder.    Ali Julia review	0
What a fantastic deal! I got a huge box of these for a great price. I love carrying these in my purse and in my backpack. I take them all over with me. I like these better than the little bottles of hand sanitizer because they do not squish out. I have had more purses and bags ruined or drenched in sanitizer because of the little bottles. These wrapped wipes are perfect for me no leaking, no squishing, just perfect! I love them and love them scent! They are perfect for what I need!! You can also drop these in the kids backpacks for easy access too!! Don't forget camping season is coming up we are planning on taking these with us.	1
I always shoot with a lens hood.  This can be attached to the camera in reverse for easy storage.  Very easy to use.	0
I waited so patiently for this to come out of the vault!  My VHS broke, I bought this as soon as it came out!<br />As I've said before, I love Disney!!<br />This is one of my childhood favorites!  Worth the wait!<br />There are deleted songs, and fun bonus features.  Great for kids!	0
The bookends are cute, but all the wooden pieces had to be glued together.  A hassle that I did NOT expect from the description and picture.	0
It sucks on the picture but when you see it in person it's really pretty. I've bought this as a model props. I am satisfied!	1
Very nice and great price!!<br />You cant beat this price for this quality. This might be the best wallet I have purchased.	0
My grandson loves the weird creature and plays with it constantly.<br />he also takes it on long car trips and visit.	0
It is too early for me to write a review however I have slightly narrow feet and the Olukia apparently running a little large but appear to be quite comfortable otherwise.	0
Worked great and provided the extra power I needed while on a trip where NO power was available to recharge!	0
The main surprise was the range of motion this vest allows.  This is a great vest for conditioning with good weight distribution in upper body pockets.  The weights are easy to load and unload.  Granted, 10 pounds is not that much weight for the upper body, but it makes a big difference for things like climbing stairs and practicing MMA.<br /><br />The inside has enough padding to prevent the 10 pounds of weights (20 half pounds) from creating discomfort.<br /><br />Unlike a lot of people, I do not believe in using this for basketball because it just puts more torque on the knees.	0
This one of many such products in the categoriy that don't have their proper dimension published. We need to know the dimension in order to estimate if the product fits our needs. If Amazon wants to wast money on product returns, keep on going like this!<br />WHY????	0
I just want to say the product are awesome. it is really effective for me. I love to BBQ and this is the perfect product for me.These mats work really well and make BBQing much more easier. Now i don't have to spend long time cleaning the BBQ grill, it is just so easy to clean it. The size of the mask is good and I can easily grill chicken, fish and all kinds of meat.<br />I'm really happy after using these mats.	1
This is a great lamp. It has a bright light and it looks great wherever you put it in the room. It's easy to setup too.	1
This is a very very basic cover for the ipad. It's not going to take a beating for long and it's not going to last long if you try to beat it up.<br /><br />This is a case that will work well if you have a brief case or bag that you put your ipad in when not in use. It doesn't have a lot of the frills that other cases have though. The case itself is a bit thinner than most of the others that I've used and already I see that the corners are curling up a little. Also the fabric cover around the binding seems very thin and like it will wear through rather quick. I tend to slide my case around on the desk a lot and I see some areas that are already concerning me.<br /><br />Does it hold the ipad though, sure it does. It's not exactly a great fit but it's not a high priced cover either.<br /><br />I can easily see needing 2 of these a year but if you are nice to your case you should be able to get a good year out of it.	0
Ideal gift bag for all my gifts to my friends and special someone this Christmas season. Cool colors as well.	1
Update 2012- When I bought the table it was a great deal, about a third of the current price. I'm not sure it's worth the current one since similar tables still sell for less than what I paid elsewhere.	1
Price? lower than anywhere else, online or retail... Quality? Identical to the OEM that was already installed in my vehicle... Shipping? even faster than promised...fit? perfect fit into my vehicle....Do I recommend this product from this seller? you guess!!! HELL YES	0
Well I am here to let you know that my buy came totally lovely ! No broken pieces with the case with which I wish I could get with all my feet that I will be utilizing. I never truly utilized my machine I called it the monster . Sixteen years prior I got hitched and attempted to learn all alone before YouTube . It was a bad dream! Nobody needed to show me its similar to a wrongdoing to show somebody an aptitude that you learned and decline to go down!	1
I like the looks of the shoe, but Clark's shoes don't seem to be made as well as they use to be.  The straps when fastened do not cover all of the velcro.  They are too short and do not look really nice.  I wear a small shoe and other than the strap being too short, they fit ok.  I am not returning them because I got a good price and will be ok for wear shopping, around the house, etc.  If you can find these in a local store, try on first to see if strap bothers you.  They are less expensive online.	0
The earrings were exactly what I was looking for I was thrilled when I opened the package, thinking it would be a Cheap in Quality for the price i was paying. Wrong i was, its BEAUTIFUL quality and looks stunning. I don't think you will find anything like this anyplace else at this price. highly recommended!!!	1
This is the one I am finding, super mini and white one I liked!! works great when Plugged it in my toyota car, and paired with the Torque on Android Play store via Bluetooth.	1
My daughter loves it. She has it on for hours now. She can't wait for halloween. It is on facebook already.Everybody put &#34;Likes&#34;. Funny and colorful. I recommend it for kids and young adults.	1
I bought this charm for my mother-in-law for Easter.  She has a Chamilla bracelet and I wanted to get her something both Irish and significant of Easter.  This charm fit the bill.  It's even better in person.  I will be ordering another one for my own mom.  Great charm for the price.	0
I was expecting much on this , cause we have lots if deer passing on the road here in our place and their in group. I was excited to try this ,but the deer never bother. nothing happened putting this in the car, never expect this us only how it look in real.	1
The case was ok - just more cumbersome than I expected. The material was kind of thin and I wasn't sure how it would hold up so I returned it. It wasn't defective or anything and it would probably work for other people - it just wasn't quite what I wanted.	0
For those of you who like to read a captivating mystery that also allows you to &#34;sense, feel, see, smell, hear - close your eyes and you are there&#34; style of book, this is the one!  I laughed, smiled, wished, hoped, sighed and cried along with the characters of it.  The twists and turns of this book were brilliant and kept me guessing, right to the end.  One of the absolute best reads I've had in a long time!  Thank you Mr. Hula!!	0
This coffee is more of a shock / humor gift for someone than it is a coffee gift.  I say that because this stuff is just okay.  I didn't really notice that this was more effective than typical coffee.<br /><br />TASTE: If you like a dark coffee, you'll like this.  It's a little harsh though.<br /><br />SMELL:  It smells a little on the burnt side.<br /><br />WAKE UP FACTOR: Mediocre compared to it's claim.<br /><br />PRICE: Too high for what it is.<br /><br />If you want some coffee that will really wake you up, tastes good, and are will to pay $20 a pound - BUY DEATH WISH!  Death Wish is a much better coffee and REALLY wakes you up.	0
This is a chai tea, so I expected some cream in the product like the traditional Chai.  This is just tea, no sweetener, no cream.  Tea is strong and pumpkin flavor is satisfying but value beyond the convenience of the K-Cup.  It is cheaper to buy Twinings Chai Pumpkin Spice Tea Bag.	0
Have had a great experience with the robots so far. The apps are cool, and my daughter loves playing with Dash together with her friends.	1
Like the ZS19, the ZS 20 delivers. Great travel camera. Lightweight ( compared to the new Canon XS700 it is like a feather), sleek and quick. Great pix, and lots of great features. Price at 170 is perfect. A better value than its newer sibling ( ZS25) from Panasonic.	0
We bought these to give as Christmas gifts. My husband used his already and was very happy with it. Kept him warm, sized correctly and held up to wash. Very nice jacket for cool weather. Makes a great inexpensive gift that you know they will use.	1
alright so i see some of the people that have reviewed about the item i think they don't know what is it for, first of all i use it when i play with mario bros, now the way it works is that when you use it, the SD card gives you infinite lives and you don't have to worry about it, is as if you were using cheats but you really using something that is allow in the game, is a little confusing to explain but i think everyone should try it.<br /><br />i only use it for mario bros not with any other games, i haven't tried it because i really don't own any games but in the bottom of the package it is names all the games it is capable of doing the "cheats" is a really good thing if you cant pass a level or if you are stuck on one.<br /><br />i highly recommend it, is really godd but is only for nintendo.	1
OK, I have never tried a product like this but I will never hesitate again to try one. I have only used this a couple times and my skin feels softer and more smooth than it has in a while. Ive even noticed a small decrease in redness in my cheeks and chin. The smell is a little bad but it goes away as it soaks into the skin. I also used this prior to putting on make up and it worked almost like a primer. Just remember to let it dry first. I will for sure be purchasing some more once I run out. I love this serum.	1
It's not for the faint of hearts. If you can get past the bloody graphics, it is a totally awesome game.	1
The beach tent is perfect. It is really lightweight, so it is easy to carry with you. It provides great shadow at the beach and the setup and breakdown are very easy.	1
This is exactly what I've been looking for and decided you could no longer get a quality scoop that actually worked! I love it. Thanks! Works just as advertised. Takes the hardest ice cream and makes it almost scoop itself. My wife always used to have sore wrists after fighting with our old one, this one its a breeze.	1
It's nice when everyone has its own cube, saves time to unpack. The only thing that I didn't quite like are the handles. Nice cubes. Keeps items organized in bag.	1
I thought the face would be bigger but it is just 1 1/8&#34; wide.  I still like it though and would recommend it.	0
I expected something else.  I have to cook them so long in order for me to eat them.  They're rubbery.	0
These were advertised as &#34;Aluminum&#34; Tunisian Crochet hooks or afghan hooks.  I received cheap plastic hooks.  I was not satisfied.	0
Sucks. Will be returning. It says they stick um no I was out in a very public flea market bent over and one fell out	0
After a lifetime of using cheap shampoo, I decided to try something better and see if it made a difference. Since I was going to spend real money, I wanted something that had no sulfates or any other problematic chemical, plus I wanted to like the smell and how it made my hair feel. This is excellent on all counts, and I really don't want to go back to the cheap stuff, so I think we have a winner. The smell, in particular... I'm going to go an see if they make an air freshener like this now.	0
Nice.. heavy.. looks good!.. I like the look of tungsten. . Wanted to try it out.. Not disappointed at all.	0
very well made umbrella...perfect size for my son! he loves anything pokemon and the handle is super cute	0
Great price for a great product. They are well made and very rugged.. I have a feeling they will last. Very good durability	1
I bought my GT P1000 last year and I was very happy at first. Now that it's more than a year, I get more and more disappointed with it.<br />A month after I bought the item, 2nd gen Galaxy Tabs were released with the same price. At first I didn't feel any regret but then my GT crashes so many times the longer it's in my hands. It keeps turning off for no reason. Sometimes I just compose text and out of nowhere it reboots. Sometimes I don't use it that much then the graphics get all wrecked (I really can't tell what happens exactly but the colors somewhat distort or something) It showed during the first few months I bought it but not too often and would usually go back to normal once I reboot but now it's really becoming annoying.<br />It's also bulky and heavy not like the new ones. I just gave away my GT to my brother after a year because it annoys me too much just looking at it.<br />I liked it when I bought it and thought I made a good investment but I regret having it. I gave it three stars because the specs overall is still good but it doesn't live up to how it should.	1
Fantastic. Great sound and polyphony for the money. If what you are trying to do is learn notes, fingering, or lay down sounds for digital arranging, this is a good choice.Shipped very quickly, arrived in great shape. We would probably have destroyed the keyboard with one thousand hammers if not for the included headphones. Good thinking.	1
I love that I can charge my battery without having another cord-as I bought this because my camera cord turned up missing.	1
These guys are simply the best! There is no way I'm choosing any other brand over this. I have tried several leather bags companies, claiming to be original leather, but no! Everyone I have tried has either been a fraud and would deliver a very low quality, poor leather bag, or they were way too expensive. Before I found this awesome brand, I had completely lost my trust over these online bag selling companies. But Ecocraftworld has changed all that.  I can confidently say that these guys have won my trust. Their quality of leather is just out of this world. I use there wide range of bag collections for all purposes now. This bag in particular is the best one of them all. It's my personal favorite and I carry this almost everywhere I go. It's super stylish and has all the room I need for my papers, my tab and a huge mac.  I can easily recommend ecocraftworld's products to all my friends and family. And this one in specific! Go for it guys, you won't regret it.	1
I got this collar because of the 5 star glowing reviews.  Turns out to be a dud.  The collar quit working after a single use and it wasn't mishandled by the dog.  It will no longer charge nor turns on.  Don't be fooled like me.  The five star reviews are probably fake reviews made up by the company.  I guess I'm such a sucker.	1
Good soundtrack, had variety, one of the tekkens with an actual plot(3 4 and 5 were slightly plot heavy)<br />this period in time tekken was great, had that underground dark atmosphere than when 6 came(best combat)but 6 was brighter in comparison regarding tone and storytelling, which in 6 was ridiculous.	0
I have been drinking lipton iced tea for what seems like forever. If you drink a lot of tea, then the packaging is perfect for you. Everyone in my family drink iced tea so it is nice to be able to quickly have a cup hot or cold, both are delicous. I would also recommend this iced tea mix, [[ASIN:B009PIEW3O 100% Pure Instant Iced Tea Powder (Unsweetened) 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]. It comes in a resealable foil bag so whether you want to make a bunch or just a cup its quick and easy to do. Plus it is literally the only tea I've tasted that actually rivals lipton without even adding any sweetener to it, really really good.	1
I'm a long time lover of the series and have bought and played almost every single one. I received this game on launch day and like most others I was unable to log in and play.  Now a month out I can easily log in and play but many of the original problems with the game still exist.  I get numerous issues with areas not getting access to water or power or garbage or &#60;insert service here&#62; without any reason.  I often have areas adjacent to a service that don't receive that service.<br /><br />I can actually live with these issues however and it isn't the reason for the low rating.  My biggest gripe is not the always on nature DRM but the actual reliance on the servers.  Because of their servers I can't save the game when I want to and this causes lots of issues.  Lose your connection, be it your fault or theirs and you lose all progress.  Just today I had an issue after bulldozing a buidling which caused a pop up to say the game was no longer working correctly.  To correct the issue my choices offered by the game were:<br />1. Delete your city completely<br />2. Lose all the progress on the city since the last time it was saved<br /><br />Of course since I don't get to save the game I have no idea what will be lost.  Turns out I lost my entire game session (about 3 hours).  Ugh.  Probaby the last time I play.	0
My niece loves American Girl and wanted her birthday to consist of gifts from the store. Of course $100/item is absurd for an aunt to spend (sorry but it isn't going to happen). I found this scooter on Amazon and thought she would love it. Sure enough, it was a hit. The only thing to be wary of is keeping her 2 yr old brother away from it. He wants to ride the scooter. Of course it's too small for him but so far the toy hasn't been broken yet!	0
Seems to be well stiched,  I sowed it on my underarmour jacket,  which is black with red down the arms. The patches red goes perfectly.  It's all about Jesus	0
Love this thing.  Tips:<br />1.) I start with a very fine (expresso) grind (2 scoops)<br />2. Water in the kettle until just before it sings.  For me this gives about 185 f water<br />3.) Have the plunger at the ready:<br />  A.)  When you pour the water, quickly stir then put the plunger on top and just enough to seal<br />  This keeps the water from seeping out too quickly<br />4.) After about 10-15 seconds, plunge away<br />5.) Top-off with more hot water and bam! Great coffee<br /><br />I generally drink mine black.  If you like black flavorful coffee but don't appreciate that burn in your throat from the harshness you get from auto-drip, you'll be happy with this.<br /><br />Also, for iced coffee:<br /> * Same method as above but don't worry about topping off.  Just mix cream and sugar to taste to the coffee while it's hot. Then pour over ice.<br /><br />Cheers!	0
chair was delivered falling out of box. I took a chance purchasing this for the reason of costing less than similar chairs in local stores. It was good while it lasted as it became almost impossible to push recliner back into the chair.	0
Got these to replace a crappy set of coby speakers. These speakers are amazing the way they sound the bass doesn't over power the other speakers soo there just great!	0
Very simple, typical clear case! I wouldn't say there is anything special or unique but it is a nice heavier plastic, and will be used to cover a Skinnit decal.	0
Nice sports bra, but fit is off. I wear a 34/36 C in bras. I had originally ordered 2 of these in Medium from another site. The band size was good, but the bra part squished my girls. I ordered the Large from Amazon and the chest is good, but the band is really loose. I'm going to keep them anyway. I'll run them through the dryer the first time. I accidentally did that with another sports bra and it shrunk a lot..	0
The images don't really do this cable justice. In real life, it certainly looks formidable. After over a week of daily use, I have had no problem with any part of this cable. It can be difficult to insert the key in the keyhole, but I think this is an anti-lock picking measure. Unless the thing I'm locking to is quite large, I am usually able to thread the cable through both wheels and frame of my bike. The cable easily stretches out to its full length when you need to use it and easily returns to its coiled form when you need to put it away. The velcro tie that is included is certainly very convenient and useful. All three (identical) keys that came with the cable worked perfectly. I promise to update this review if my bike is stolen and this cable is involved.	0
I bought the Nautica chronograph N14536G a couple of days ago. Prompt delivery. Received the watch in good condition. The watch itself looks as good as it does on the screen... a good, solid watch... sporty looks and feel. Some might think it is heavy, which it probably is, but I have no problems there. My main complain is that the manual that comes with the watch is useless... does not have specifications/ help for this particular model. Also the seconds hand is the tiny dial at the 6 O'Clock position and the main "seconds" dial is for the stop watch, which I find weird in a watch.<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a good buy, if you don't mind a heavy watch. I even got a pair of Nautica binoculars free!! And no one can beat Amazon's price.	1
The clear sides of the case became blue after carrying it in my jeans pocket for a few hours only. I don't know how this happened but it has never happened before. This shows clearly how bad the quality of the case is. I undermined the negative reviews and got this case anyway but they were right. Lesson learned!!	1
Would love to get this shirt for my girlfriend, she wears a medium. Of course they have every size but... Medium is a very common size for women yet a lot of stuff I see and want to buy is not available in medium, work on it!!!	0
This is a great price on this product. I have seen supplements like this and even ones that contain similar ingredients that are much more expensive. It's a shame that this one isn't more famous because everyone deserves a chance at eating right and losing weight. I would say to get this product if you can, and give it a shot.	1
Instead of buying a huge, expensive TV I purchased the projector( 710 HD) for use as a TV. and works just as well. I have also seen the 705HD in action Projector works great with lighting. I have four large windows surrounding the screen and I still get great HD picture.. Dark movies may require to dim the room alittle in the daytime. I am beyond satisfied with my projector so far. Make sure you mount your projector at night to ensure the keystones (picture sizing) will fit. It's just amazing.	0
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE IT, PLEASE UNDERSTAND THIS KILLS ANY AND ALL INSECTS VERY GOOD STUFF, MY NEIGHBOR GOT BEDBUGS AND I HAD ALREADY APPLIED THIS, AND BECAUSE OF THAT THEY COULD NOT SPREAD TO MY APARTMENT, AND AFTER SEVERAL TREATMENTS SHE USE THIS AND NO LONGER HAS ROACHES OR BEDBUGS	0
Quality is definitely there, they were just a little too big.  Thank you for making the returns simple even I can do it! I did reorder a smaller size.  Thanks Amazon and Gress!	0
I have a late 2008 Macbook and it had slowed down to the point of not functioning. These took care of the issue and I'm very satisfied with the performance.	0
I thought that this was going to be a great product but it only ended up being a huge disappointment. I was so sure that it would be great too. The sound is just all over the place and it kind of hurts.	1
amazing and comfortable for my work out process has became somewhat reliable with this product as its really comfortable to use and its really durable for builders who wanna work out without missing even a day.	1
these are good lables, i like that they are made from recycled material. i gave three stars because im using these on small bottles that are round and these lables dont stick on something round very well at all. i have to use tape to keep the sides down. wouldnt get these for that purpose again. but over all these are decent.	0
For the price this is very powerful and well made.I liked it so much I bought one for another family member and had it shipped to him.	1
This was expected to fit the handle which I already have but the holes in middle are different. Not a fit so now I need to buy the handle.	0
Coconut oil has so many great uses! I love this oil. Since receiving it I've used it for many things. I love using it when shaving my legs. It leaves me skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I also use it as a massage oil. I love the pump that came with mine. It makes it easier to get the right amount I want, and convenient as well. The bottle is huge, and I have a fair amount that I know will last me a long time. This is top quality coconut oil, and has benefited me in so many ways since using it. I was so glad to be given the opportunity to test this product at a very special price, and share my experiences and feedback. I recommend this product to everyone. There are so many benefits to using this oil, and you won't be disappointed.	0
I am no professional but now with this filter kit I can fool all my friends and family into thinking the pictures I take are pro quality.  All this for a great price also and it comes with a handy little carrying case.	1
I have a fairly remote access point for my WiFi. I had purchased this subwoofer kit to set up some active speakers on my balcony. Even though this product is called subwoofer kit, it is actually a full-frequency audio link. After reading the positive reviews I gave it a try.<br /><br />Unfortunately it turns out that no matter where I place either of the wireless units, as soon as the receiver links up with the transmitter, my WiFi is gone. No more access to the AP. Bummer.	1
I bought this Australian tea tree oil because I had heard of the wonderful healing that people had seen after using it.  I got a very bad burn and thought I would give it a try.  I thought it was great that I was getting a blemish roll on stick for free.  Well,I love the blemish stick!  It is so easy to use and I have found that it really has helped my complexion to look better. I have found that it does a great job of getting around my ear, where I was burned, too.	1
For the price, you cant complain. They fit according to size, they are moderately comfortable, and they look good for work. My only complaint is they almost always need to be ironed out after the wash. They easily wrinkle. but i still give it a 4/5	0
Well worth the money. Direct fit.  Has a nice look to it when seen at a distance.  Might need new lower control arm bolts when installing.  Old ones might be stuck	0
Not good. faucets I bought have a leak and cannot be fixed. Do not spend the money on labor - not worth it.	1
This item is user-friendly; I can either carry it or throw it in my pocketbook. I love how you can use in different positions. All work perfect. Love the convenience.	1
As you can see the design of this case is specially built for small kids you can see the small details in the product that have been thought of to build this.<br />The handle is flexible and can turn into a stand to enjoy games, movies and other apps because at time small kids can't hold the ipad for long.<br />This product has all of my votes and I recommend it to everyone.	1
Arrived quicker than I had expected. I use them everyday, has pretty good sound and quality. Overall I enjoy using them and love it.	0
Whether it's for popcorn powder, salt, sugar or whatever type of powder condiment, this will work well as a dispenser.	1
This is particularly useful when working on floating objects like electrical outlets or car parts, or when working in tight spaces with it set to the straight grip position.	1
This is truly an awesome product.  It's a good thing the reviews here were accurate.  I deserves a 5 star rating easy.  It's easy to use. Provides safe drinking water.	1
I'm a bit neurotic in general:) When it comes to by body I don't want it to get used to anything for fear that I will become immuned to effects. AT any given time I will have a minimum of 4 different hair/body products, toothpaste, vitamins, you name it. My diet and exercise regimen varies greatly by the day. I tried this and noticed that my abdomen looked and felt smaller and tighter the next morning. I loved it so I did not use the next day. I take it once or twice a week and love how it fits into my neurotic life.	1
i love this. i'm a Harry Potter freak who's about to get their license, so this is perfect. so far, the paint or whatever it is hasn't chipped yet. i've had this since summer.	0
Gave it a four star only because there is really no information with it .Recipes for salad dressing mainly need some directions of what you can do with blender as a whole .	1
Large Bag Made of High Quality material. Leather Trimmed Haul Handles made it very comfortable and easy to use. Due to its big Size it has large capacity to store things. It is just perfect for carrying out during vacations and weekends and it very useful to carry your cloths during gym. Perfect travel bag for me and I would highly Recommend all to use this stylish looking bag for travel purposes.	1
The dvds arrived in the excellent condition that they were promised.  Price was good, also.  We watched these on netflix and were sorry that only 2 seasons were made by HBO.  A super change from alot of the &#34;stuff&#34; that is described as entertainment nowadays.  Wish there were more episodes.....	0
I love the Oakland A's & the story of Billy Bean & how he managed & still manages the A's Baseball team.  If you love baseball, or statistics & math & gambling type of thinking, then you will love this movie.  It also has a lot of heart & is a true story of a great manager & team.  I love Oakland A's & SF Giants Bruce Bochy. I want more movies about great managers like Bruce Bochy & Billy Bean.  Oh, & Brad Pitt does a great job of playing his character.<br />This is a great movie to own on the collection shelf & is very unique from any other managing style or movie. I LOVE this movie!!	0
cyrus & Mahin serry<br />story of the life of a great achiever must read<br /> enjoyed reading the book for at least one reason. Most children who are born into rich, well-connected families are less eager to work hard and so become spoiled or useless members of society. In contrast, Dr Khonsari used the opportunities offered to him by his family for the betterment of his knowledge and skill, which he applied towards helping others. This book should be read by everyone, whether connected to medicine or not. I commend the writer for his life-long efforts and for sharing his invaluable experience with the world.	1
This item was ordered for a family BBQ and arrived in the time required thank to amazons delivery service. Sadly the product was so badly made it was unplayable, as all of the wood blocks were too rough to slide as they weren't sanded at all. the finish just really made this item horrid. I have sent it back for a refund. the Bag looked like one of those free bags that you get your shopping in from the Mall - awful - AVOID	1
It is an awesome stylist snorkel set.It very easy to carry.I have never used a snorkel that worked so well.I feel very comfortable with it.	1
They worked very well, fitted the Ethernet cable properly, and held well in place. A holding tool might have been nice,<br />I hit my finger with the hammer trying to hold them in position to hammer them in.	0
I've had this chair for a few weeks now and find it to be a fairly comfortable chair. Seems pretty solidly built, which for the price was a question mark. Only time will tell how it holds out, but as of now I'd recommend it.	1
Loving this screen protector! Just got mine recently purchased and all I can say is that the screen protector seems to be great. It's not like some any other cheap screen protectors from the market that is made out of plastic, this one comes in glass made with polished, rounded edges which makes the phone more safe from any cracks when accidentally dropped with the front cover facing. I have never dropped my phone since adding this one but pretty sure this one will save my device from cracking its surface because of its durability and Diamond Glass Technology,	1
Keeps me secure from the sun or rain. Could have given this a perfect score but because folding and unfolding the umbrella takes a while, I had to make the necessary adjustments.	1
Id heard about this show but never seen it before so was delighted to receive this as a gift recently - its an amazing spcatacle and a DVD all Cheap Trick fans should own	1
fits perfect and it is beautiful. This was one of the best purchase I've ever made. This looks so wonderful. I love this decal its great! LOOOOOOOVE IT.	1
Very strong structure and the back support is movable like a recliner and can lock at different angles which make it even more comfortable.	0
Very easy to set up. Open box and unfold. Very sturdy and space efficient. Draw back is that this desk is a tad short. I kept hitting my knees every time I worked on it. We ended up moving it to the girls room. Because of this, height of desk, I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars (and I'm only 5'3&#34;). Read specs carefully before purchasing to make sure your leg room is sufficient.	1
I carried this bag around Europe and never had any problems with product.  It sits on the front of you and has plenty of pockets including one with protection from credit card magnetic strip stealing.  It can get heavy if you pack it too full.	0
Gets the job done and comes off with ease. Affordable and I'd say good quality frisket, too. It can be *slightly* hard to see when painting it onto paper due to the colour of it, but other than that.. No complaints here!	0
Very disappointed at how quickly this tarnishes and gets a greenish tint where the water goes. I do not have hard water and none of my other fixtures have this problem.	1
I bought three of these for cable storage.  It is a perfect size.  Some advice: buy all three color for quick identification.  Tough container and strong zipper. No problems yet.	0
Love the picture. I didn't pay attention to the size when I ordered it so I really wish it was a bigger picture. I'll keep it though because I still love the sayings!	1
After powering up the speakers and syncing with my phone, there was a loud clunking sound. After that silence. Now the speakers won't even sync anymore.	1
We use these fans in all our bathroom remodels, they are the best fans on the market. They are quiet and effective. I recommend these fans to anyone upgrading or adding an exhaust fan.	1
Excellent rollers. They fit well and were perfect to replace the roller that I had broken on my office chair.	0
it should have been so much better but you made everything inside the box so cheap. im glad i didnt just hand my girlfriend the box cause it was cheap and why would you put the price on the tag on the necklace like come on. i gotta order a small jewelry gift thing now...	1
This is one of the greatest product I got on Amazon so far when it comes to waist trimming. I like it and I always use it when I work out because I sweat more when I have this. I really like it a lot.	1
This unit is doing its job, in terms of navigation. It gets GPS signal (not very fast, but it gets...) and it does not have huge location errors. It looks good and the remote control is also very handy. Unfortunately, the maps updating process is almost impossible.	1
Correct fit just as advertised.  Looks and feels like the solid silver I already have.  Just as advertised.  Thank you	0
You are just a flashcard away from great test prep. In this system of flashcards, get ready to explore CNOR test prep a little bit differently. Flashcards offer you the opportunity to reviews lots of information in a short amount time so that you can retain said information. Just grab a flashcard and get going.<br /><br />This flashcard system is very simple in design, so you do not have to worry about figuring out the packaging before you get started. They are setup on a simple format that is easy to follow and go through. Although the flashcards follow the study guide, you do not have to worry about the extra information like bonus material and tips and tools. Of course, those are valuable and needed. However, this set of flashcards allows you to get to the meat of the material by only offering study content on each card.<br /><br />What is that study content? Through this set of cards explore, patient assessment and diagnosis, expected outcomes and plan of care, intraoperative activities, communication and much more. As indicated by the subject matters, there is much to review through the flashcard set. However, do not feel that you must review each card in order. Go through the cards by analyzing what you do not know, what you want to review, and what you have mastered.<br /><br />These cards speak volumes when it comes to preoperative care and the surrounding components. Make sure you listen well to acquire success on the exam.	1
This purchase is good, I am quite impressed with the quality because I've tried a couple of resistance bands before which lasted for a month, these bands are tough and has very impressive quality considering the price. I recommend this brand.	1
This is a really fun game that is similar to settlers of Catan or other worker placement games. Tons of fun and if you know the forgotten realms stories it makes it even more fun.	1
These are soooo good. They remind me of Kind bars - nuts, chocolate, all good for you stuff. These are more like candybars, however, in that they have quite a bit of organic sugar. But, they're so much better for you (as they're organic cane and not HFCS ) and they really do satisfy the desire for something sweet while still being good for you.Fresh tasting cashews, yummy  chocolate, nice combo of crunchy/chewy texture.	0
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it is (still, like all others) not maintenance-free -- the springs still require lubrication. I got one for my son a year ago and he uses it regularly. He reports it has gotten really noisy. I can report, from many years of experience with a Needak rebounder, that oil helps. But, over time, very slowly and unnoticed, microdrops of oil built into stains on the carpet. We are going to try small amounts of white (lithium) grease, instead (think Pep Boys). Eventual spring breakage and replacement is unavoidable. And, stubborn as I am, I ignore their advice and replace them only as they break; not all at the same time.<br />I bought a Cellerciser for myself at my son's urging due to the gentleness of the rebound itself. It is far gentler, which is important if disc verterbra impact is important to you.<br />In summary, it is the best I have experienced and would recommment it highty. Tri-fold and rolling carry case are great.<br />My personal opinion only: I think the &#34;maintenance problem&#34; with the bungee type rebounder will be worse due to the expense of the bungees and frequency of replacement. If silence is primary, bungee is the choice.	0
YOu can see easily through the pen how much ink there is left. (the picture of the pens does not really show that so clearly, but I like this feature because then you know when you need refills!)<br /><br />The quality of these pens is excellent!	1
I am looking to replace the CFL floods in my home so I bought 4 different LED floods and compared them to my current Feit CFLs.<br /><br />1. Great Eagle PAR38 LED  15 Watt 1260 Lumens  3 Yrs Warranty<br />2. Great Eagle PAR30 LED 10 Watt 850 Lumens  3 Yrs Warranty<br />3. Feit LED BR30 LED 13 Watts 750 lumens 5 Yrs Warranty<br />4. G7 Power Elko BR30 15 Watt 1100 Lumen 10 Yrs Warranty<br />5. Feit R40 CFL 23 Watt 1300 Lumens  - replaced by new bulbs<br />6. Feit R30 CFL 15 Watt 750 Lumens<br /><br />I have 6 recessed lighting fixtures in my kitchen so I put one of each LED bulbs in 4 of the fixtures and ran them beside 2 Feit 15 Watt 750 Lumen CFLs for reference. Below is my impression of the bulbs.<br /><br />The Great Eagle PAR38 is VERY bright.  By far the brightest, highest lumens rating, of the LEDs.  Based on the numbers provided it is also the most efficient at 105 lumens/watt.  I currently do not have it on a dimmer, which is needed because my kitchen has 9' ceilings and the bulb is too bright.  Much brighter than the Feit 1300 Lumen CFL it replaced even though it is rated for slightly fewer lumens.  It is also whiter since it's a 3000k bulb. With its increased brightness and the 3000k whiter light it is a poor match for my kitchen without a dimmer as things are just too bright.  I have dimmers so I will update the review once installed.  This bulb is the closest I have seen to a halogen and I like the clear glass compared to the frosted the others use. It has a very sophisticated and stylish look.  Over all this seems like a very well built efficient LED flood.<br /><br />The Great Eagle PAR30 at 850 lumens is similar to the PAR38 in design and is a better match for my kitchen without using a dimmer.  The 3000k light is much more comfortable at lower levels - not as overwhelmingly bright. Also a very efficient LED at 85 lumens/watt.  I liked this LED a lot.  With good color, style and efficiency this LED is a good choice.<br /><br />The Feit BR30 I boughtfrom Costco.  These are almost identical in color and light output to the Feit CFLs R30s.  The color is good being warm while still showing up colors well and the lumens seem correct.  The Feit is the only bulb of the 4 that did not have cooling fins built into the base to cool the electronics.  After being run for several hours the base is HOT to the touch.  You can pick it up by the glass but not the base.  At 57 lumens/watt it is less efficient than the Great Eagles but has good color.<br /><br />I have been buying the Feit brand CFLs for years and over all have been very unhappy with their short life span.  In less than 5 years I have replaced all the Feit CFLs in my kitchen at least twice.  Bulbs rated for 10,000 hrs, 9yrs at 3hrs per day, are lasting less than 2 years.  Even as much as CFLs have come done in price I am still losing money replacing them at this rate.  If it were not the fact that I believe in living green I would have given up.<br /><br />The G7 Power Elko BR30 is interesting.  They come with a 10 years warranty (printed on the box) which is an amazing statement and very reassuring given my experience with Feit early failures.  It also has very large cooling fins built into the base and can be handled easily after run for several hours.  However they are also noticeably more yellow.  Compared to the Feit 2700k LED and CFL they have a yellowish tint.  Side by side with the 3000k Great Eagle they seem too soft and colors are washed out.  If you only use these I am sure it would not be as noticeable.  Also even though they are rated at 1097 Lumens they are not as bright at the Feits LED or CFL which are rated at 750.  Based on the brightness compared to the Great Eagles PAR30 and PAR38 the ELKOs are not putting out there rated lumens.  The manufacture states efficiency at 73 lumens/watt but based on observation I would say it's closer to 700 lumens output which would make it 46 lumens/watt( 700/15).  Over all good construction but the light outputis disappointing when compared to the other bulbs both in color and brightness.	0
My cat craves cat grass every day. And I know it sounds silly, but as a vegetarian, I secretly adore his love of greens!<br /><br />I used to buy cat grass kits over and over - as soon as the leaves were all eaten, I'd have to go buy another kit. With this bag of seeds, I can keep fresh cat grass growing for my kitty in the house at all times. Highly recommend!	0
I guess it's true you get what you pay for. With 12 megapixels I expected to get a very good picture but it's much worse than my 6 megapixel Kodak. I trusted the name Bell & Howell because they've been around a long time but I shouldn't have. I would not recommend this camera to anyone.	1
After much research I decided to go with the UM pro 30's for their 3 armature crossover set up.  These little bad boys are just awesome. Highs are crisp and have a presence but not overwhelming, Mids warm and filling, and the Lows just perfect not over powering the rest of the soundstage.  Just got these and within the last hour of continuous play I have no regrets whatsoever.  Comfortable and the perfect amount of sound isolation.  Will post more after a few more weeks of use.	0
It is not Christmas in our household until we have seen this movie. It's been a tradition with us for many many years and I hope our kids pass this on when they are old enough to have a family.	1
these are printed red, but not fluorescent making them really hard to see at a distance (which is why I ordered these). Will look for a better option in the future.	1
I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha	1
When I bought a 1080 flat screen, had to dump my old DVD player as the screen image was pointless. I'm not ready for Blue Ray, so got this and am very happy with it. Compared to my old player, the &#34;basic&#34; DVDs I play look great. The price was right. My only complaint: you can't eject a disc via the remote; have to use the button on the player which seems odd to me.	0
We're renovating one of our B&B suites and put this in a walk in shower room. The fan is great at is the heating and lighting and the wall switch is slick looking. It installed easily and looks wonderful.	1
I needed an individual diary to compose and convey that looked decent like an old style diary. This was simply great. I cherish the craftsmanship of this minimal diary. It might be little however that makes it compact and can be taken pretty much anyplace. It will fit most into medium size totes, packs, and so on. The shading is only delightful alongside the leave impressions in the cowhide spread.	1
This mic stand is by far the best one I have ever worked with. I have bought so many from local stores for almost 2x the price. This one not only comes cheaper, and its sturdier! Easily adjustable and the boom is good length.	1
I make homemade soaps and these work great for packaging. Very good quality material. I continue to purchase these. Work great seal well.	0
Can't complain at all for the time I have been using this product. Just works as described and came with an installation guide which was quite easy to follow. Thanks amazon for such a great item and will definitely update my review with time incase I face any problem with it.	1
I used this scabbard on my Sears 20 inch electric chain saw that I bough at a yard sale.  It had no scabbard with the saw from the yard sale and I ordered this one.  My chain saw is a 20 inch and the scabbard is from an 18 inch to a 22 inch, so I cut two inches from the scabbard for my particular saw. It works perfectly and is very strong.  No weak plastic on this scabbard!  The scabbard is marked for cutting if the 22 inch is not needed.  I am more than satisfied with the quality of the scabbard.  It is very strong and sturdy.	0
The sports games have a more realistic feel than the other game machines. The only drawback is my kids want to play it all the time-- it has a timer feature that I need to set up, to limit the time used each day.	1
I have been drinking lipton iced tea for what seems like forever. If you drink a lot of tea, then the packaging is perfect for you. Everyone in my family drink iced tea so it is nice to be able to quickly and easily make a gallon without much mess. I would also recommend this iced tea mix, [[ASIN:B009PIEW3O 100% Pure Instant Iced Tea Powder (Unsweetened) 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]. It comes in a resealable foil bag so whether you want to make a bunch or just a cup its quick and easy to do. Plus it is literally the only tea I've tasted that actually rivals lipton without even adding any sweetener to it, really really good.	1
My son got this as a birthday present and this review is based solely on his happiness and reaction once he got it. He was so excited! He instantly ran around the house shouting at the top of his lungs to illustrate his excitement. After thanking me profusely and eating his dinner, he dove right into playing and I think he made it a goal of his to finish in a week or something. Glad I found it here on Amazon so reasonably.. I really loathe Wal-Mart and just about any store really. So yeah thanks Amazon! Keep rocking!	1
this is probably one of the best ways to transfer game, videos, music, and pictures from the computer to a PSP, i have tried lots of times just to transfer pictures and videos from itunes and from the folders of my pc but i couldn't do it because it doesn't allows it to, and none of the other ways i had tried worked either, up until now that i got the max media pro at a really good price.<br /><br />this is a time saver because is very easy to use and to manage, i can transfer anything now with a lot less time to lose because is very fast and nothing can be compared with this, you must really try it the way it is supposed to be used.<br /><br />the best way is by following the directions and to follow step by step, personally i would but it again but i already have one, i love it! the window on the computer of the max media pro is also very easy acknowledge on how to use it, but if you on the position of someone who has never used one, i bet you that you will not have any problems with this one because i didn't and i understand it very easy.<br /><br />good quality stuff right here..	1
i have bought it for my 4 months old baby. it looks nice and fit perfactly. will buy more of this if needed	1
Runs small, glad I ordered a half size larger, but still too narrow.  Very hard and uncomfortable, not even comfortable enough to wear for a few hours, I had them on for 5 minutes and had to get them off!  Picture looks super cute, but when you put them on, the ankle opening is so huge you have a huge gap in the front that looks terrible, and I don't even have skinny legs!  Very disappointed.  You get what you pay for I guess.	0
If you lose the instructions, it will be very difficult to use. Its not intuitive. If you make the mistake of resetting the entire thing, you may lose the tire size setting.	1
I am very pleased with this swim cap. Usually I have to struggle to get my hair up in the cap and then before my swim is completed, my hair has begun to come out in the back. This one works great.	1
Low price and good quality !<br />Light full, very small, very well constructed<br />In two words : highly recommended<br />(With canon 550d)	0
This is the only white sugar I use.  It's not at sharp as regular sugar and taste pretty good.  I use it in everything I bake.	0
Used this with the Beck Arnley 051-4162 Wheel Bearing on my 97' legacy and its working great so far. I have a press so the install went smooth for me.	1
If you shoot clay or birdhunt as I do you will really enjoy a box like this.  Really keeps your shells handy and organized.	0
I am adding this to my tattoo aftercare. If it promotes healing from within then I don't see anything wrong with that.	1
This head lamp really great, its bright LED Lamp.. And a lot of used on it.. Like when i go outdoor on night time and when i am looking for something in the dark.. My husband like it so much, specially when doing mechanics work in the car, and his alone. No need an assistant hold a flashlight.. He has his LED Headlamp.	1
I love this value pack because I am horrible about remembering to order more ink. This brand has a 2 year shelf life, which gives me plenty of time to use it up. The quality print is awesome as well.	1
Bought this for an older mattress and it made a HUGE difference in the comfort factor.  Put a mattress cover on top of it and the bed is finally soft and cushy!  I would highly recommend this.	0
I like this watch- it's a little bigger than most but that was the point.<br />the band is plastic so your wrist may sweat if you wear it tight.	0
I got this for my 2 year old son and he absolutely loves it! Whenever I'm not busy with something, I go and check on him. (I work on the computer in the living room, where he also is) And I see that out of all the other toys that he has, he plays with this one. I've been working for about 2-3 hours and hes still on the same toy. Since there are no small pieces there are no hazards!	1
I love my happy hacienda confetti colors silicone baking cups. You can make muffins, cupcakes, mini cheesecakes, omlets and just about anything in them. You don't even need to use a muffin pan to use them. You can place them filled on a baking sheet and they won't open. They are non stick and you don't have to add a cooking spray on them. Once the item is cooled the food item comes out without a hassle. They are easy to wash and you can even use them in the dishwasher. They are microwavable safe so u can cook in the microwave in half the time. I can't wait to see what recipes I can come up with in them.	1
This movie was not as good as the other animated films that came out this year (Monsters University and Despicable Me 2) but still a great movie for the kids. It has a unique story as snails are really slow but in this they bent reality. Kids love it but it wasn't enough for me.	1
Perfect ft for my Hinda 2013 CRV. Have collected lots of snow, dirt and muck and easy to install and clean.	0
friend of mine gave this nail clippers to me and they are just so cute to have a . the scissors are sharp enough to cut the nails of my little Natalie and the tip of the scissors has been modified to keep my baby safe from accidental punctures. overall I am impressed by this baby nail scissors	1
Installed this amplifier on an over the air antenna array.  The insertion power option is a nice feature, eliminating one piece if there is a 110v source nearby.  I located the amplifier about half way between the antenna and the three TV's.  The power led light indicates that power is applied.  The results were very good eliminating station dropout on my most distance stations.  Nice not to pay cable or satellite companies for TV signals anymore.	0
This does not play itsy bitsy spider, so don't get it if you want that.  It lets kiddo and you pick sounds to go with each page of the book.  The ants march, the grasshoppers boing, that kind of thing.  There are some lift up flaps.  It's short and not complicated, perfect for 12-24 months.  Grover is in the book too, the combo of Elmo and Grover is super cute as they try to find where the itsy bitsy spider lives and meet other insects along the way.	0
Doilies are hard to find, unless you are willing to spend a lot of money on them.  Honestly, I needed to replace one that accidentally got devoured by our vacuum cleaner!  These are of good quality, beautiful design (the online pictures do not do them justice) and love the crisp color.	0
Baking with this mat is great!  Overflows and spills roll right off of it.  Perfect fit in my sears elite ovens	0
I got this band to replace the factory band on my luminox 3083. I kept having issues with the end of the factory band pulling loose, plus it just looked cheap compared to the watch. Well worth the upgrade. This band is much more secure and has a classier look. It looks like a nice steel band you'd expect on a dressier watch, but it's still lightweight and matches the case of the luminox. Each link of the band is held in place with a small screw, which I prefer to the springloaded pins (those always seem to launch away from me never to be seen again). Takes more tools to disassemble than pins I guess, but that wasn't an issue for me. Some reviewers complained about the screws working themselves loose...I haven't had this issue, but I would imagine that if you were worried about it, you could put a drop of loctite on the screws before reassembling the band back together	1
This cable was purchased so that i could use the mini DP on my surface pro and use my desktop monitor as an extended display. Both the HDMI cable and mini DP adapter work extremely well and feel very well built. If you have a surface pro (or any other device with a mini DP port) and wish to marvel at what it has to offer on a big screen, this is what you need!	0
For a household alarm system, this battery is a necessity and the alarm company charges twice as much for the unit, PLUS a $75 service call.  This is exactly the same down to the make, size, and specs. And install is just pull two small electrical wires and re-attach to the new unit and you’re done.	0
Not worth the money. Worthless. Wouldn't even call it jewelry. Some parts didn't even look like the picture.	0
Family vacations deserve to be immortalized, and this DSLR from canon does the job. With vivid images, clearly captured and alive, it's like we are there experiencing the whole thing again.<br /><br />At first though, I wasn't too happy with the price. But after seeing the prized pictures we brought home, seeing the kids and my wife so happy, the price was just worth it.	1
Definitely one of the best teen shows from the 90s.....great looking girls, hip guys and Mr Belding....one of the greatest characters to ever to grace the screen......worth every penny.	0
Great wireless transmitter and receiver, Very clear. Will recommend anyone that does not want to deal with wired products. Easy setup.	0
Don't buy this from Amazon. I recommend that you go to Best Buy or another box store and pay full price. When you order it, you do not get the connector to the computer. Perhaps this is best for those who have some psychic abilities and can mentally get the info on the presenter.	0
I purchased it for my husband and he loves it.  It is well balanced, easy to change positions and folds to store when not in use.	0
small non metal studs with great variety and color. Perfect for small children and the second piercing.For people who have metal algeries this is a good alturnative.	0
My wife and I were handed this while vacationing in London.  I had asked merely for regular ketchup with my burger and fries, but the server convinced us to try this Stokes Bloody Mary Ketchup ...we wouldn't be disappointed.  It was every bit as good as he said it was.  Highly recommend this over ordinary ketchup!	0
If you have never used these tuners before , you are in for a treat! New strings have never been easier to install. Great upgrade for Squier Telecasters!	0
This is an excellent review in a Question - Answer format. The fact that most books are very close in content if written by the same author is usually the case so let's not waste our time. In terms of reviewing material for exam it has everything you need and more. I would say that a few days is not enough to go thoroughly through all of it, so allow yourself a bit more time and Good Luck!	1
This did not stand up as well as I thought it would for my boy. I'll probably be returning this and getting another one that mounts directly to the wall	1
They work great. When considering these outlets I'd read reviews of a three pack of the same outlets (from a different vendor I think)not performing well for some buyers but I believe that was caused by people using the wrong battery in the remote.<br />These units ship with the correct 12v remote battery.<br />How long they will last remains to be seen.  They are after all very cheap.  However, for the money they seem to be not bad quality.<br />The size of the outlets is a slight disadvantage as it restricts what can be plugged in to the second socket of a dual socket wall outlet. However, I got round that by using a short extension cord to connect the outlet to the wall socket. The outlets work using RF so the outlets can be positioned out of sight.	0
I live in a cold appartment and although I have a heater it is not ideal since it only heats our room and it dries my baby's nose... so we decided we needed to put more layers on him but without the risk of adding blankets which is very dangerous and honestly didnt let me sleep calm thinkng the baby might suffocate.<br /><br />Neither my wife nor I knew these sleepsacks existed but I found it on Amazon and decided to purchase one ... SURPRISE!!! After 3 weeks of continuous using it (with occasional washing of course) I realized this was the best solution for the night and immediately ordered 3 more of different colors and sizes.<br /><br />Only important detail: try getting synthetic fabrics instead of cotton if you are using a drier after washing them since they do shrink. Also the model that does not hold the baby's arms is a much better option, our baby didn´t adjust well to the swaddling and he is comfortable moving his arms at night	0
Wonderful! Purchased this seat belt extension because my trip had me flying on United small planes. I have no problem on the larger planes with the seat belts but I need an extension on the smaller planes. I was able to settle in for my flight without going through the trouble of asking a flight attendant for a seat belt extension.<br />It's worth the price so buy one and relax.	1
I purchased this bubble machine for my grandson, he loves it! he plays  with his friends all the time . purpose served, so great	1
I bought them for my son as well. He's 5 months old now. He loves them. He use the bumpy blue one as a teether. The rattle one is great for grasping, shaking and making noise.	1
When you enter the world of Ken Frazier and Sam Flagg, you never know what to expect.  In this tale, J.T. Prescott has masterfully succeeded in dispelling misperceptions often held about those within the retirement generation.  When retired seniors Ken, Craig and Bill invite the more youthful and physically capable Sam Flagg into their circle of trust, they band together and use their collective &#34;arts and crafts&#34; and set out on a dangerous mission to uncover a government conspiracy that involves killing an untold number of unsuspecting american people.  The supporting characters are really developed and well written. You can certainly expect exciting action scenes with unexpected twists and turns along the journey.  This is an entertaining and interesting read. Arts and Crafts has an underlying topic that left me with a feeling of hope and a renewed respect and admiration for a sometimes overlooked retirement aged population.  I was reminded about the special knowledge and wisdom that can only be taught by those who have a lifetime of experiences to share.  Looking forward to a sequel.........	1
And the angels sing from the heavens!  This pencil sharpener is amazing!  I'll admit that I had to watch a video on how to use it, but once I figured it out, I am mesmerized by it.  After going through 15 electric sharpeners in 10 years for my classroom, this one will last quite a while.  My students will need a lesson or two on how to use it, but once they do, they'll be hooked.  The pencil points produced by this sharpener are like needles.  I was so excited by it that I had to call other teachers in to the room to see it in action.  It's a hit!	0
It appears well made. I did need to leave them open and unfilled to air them out. Hopefully the hold up after daily use.	0
I just received three of these polos today 12/05. The colors are better in person than the pictures. The Dill and Slate Blue looks really nice on, so, I am keeping them, but I Was mortified to see the red looks more like and orange-red and looked awful on my skin tone, I am a winter and look better in cool jewel tones even though I can wear some other cool autumn colors. I wrote to the seller and printed out the return label and will ship it back Monday morning before I go to work at 10:30am. Since there was no choice for return or exchange, I went ahead and ordered a navy, burgundy, brown, and white, I should get them by the 22nd. The material is a nice quality, soft and comfortable. I took the advice of the other reviewer to size up, which I am glad I did. I wear a size 14 large in tops. XL fits comfortable without hugging. They are a straight cut; I am glad I have found a non-stretch polo. These pique polos skim enough to just above the thigh  (between hip and thigh socket) just covers the abdomen. I like the two button placket and goes into a V... classy. The arm has a bit of gap, but I don't mind, I need the movement since I need to reach overhead to get supplies or planters off of shelves. I don't like being restricted to where it is uncomfortable. I I highly recommend Devon & Jones D100W Women's Pima Pique Polo 100%.  Butter yellow is soft yellow. Burgundy is a red-brown. Navy is a true Navy  Slate Blue is medium blue/grey. Purple is eggplant purple. Dill is a bit lighter than the forest green and muted. Red is like and orange/red, French Blue is between a Patriot Blue and Peacock Blue, not overly bright, but a nice tone of blue.  Update 8/2015 I bought couple more to replace the two that got stained bad and am looking to see if there are newer colors.lot.	0
I haven't been taking it for very long but I'm excited by the simplicity of the ingredients list!  The capsules are labelled as &#34;Veggie Capsules&#34; which is slightly confusing because no where does it list what exactly is in the pills, just &#34;Forskolin Blend&#34; which...could really be anything.  I plan on doing a little more research on this &#34;Coleus Forskohlii root extract&#34; :)<br /><br />Love as always,<br />~Heather	1
See Lady Sprite, the guitar I designed and built with the Bigsby B3. http://educ.jmu.edu/~dehartcg/ls_intro.htm	0
I can only describe them as pleasu-rings as the title does, really it delivers what's advertised, and the knobs that they have make the wearing of the product comfortable.	1
Got this for my husband to store tons of little electronic pieces. We ended up buying another one. Comes with all the drawer inserts.	0
This product forced me to make do with what I had, but if I have to say whether to buy it or not again, I would answer no. This product is more of a hindrance than anything if you are just grilling for fun. Don't make yourself frustrated.	1
I got this to help get rid of the moles that have started to invade my yard.  It is very easy to use.  This is a repellant and it does seem to be working .  This just repels the moles and makes them move to another area.  So you will have to continually keep applying to keep the moles from coming back.  I would rather kill them and know they are not going to come back instead of herding them to another area for a time and then just waiting for them to eventually come back.	0
It is a very nice and powerful small LED bulb with a decent price. I used it to replace my old incandescent lights in my kitchen. They are very bright, in my opinion, with a good color temperature to fit my application. Moreover, they started saving money for me on electric bill from the day one. I like the "energy saving" idea and I am considering to replace all my incandescent light with LED. I just need to spend some time t figuring out which LED light is compatible. I accidently placed two orders and asked seller to cancel one. To my surprise, their reply e-mail showed up in my e-mail within 2 hours. Amazing service！ I'd like to keep buying from them.	1
FOr a price tag below $20, the Xbox One rechargeable battery pack for wireless controller does it for me. It's affordable and works without any issue. Well, that's all I need it to do! You should consider arming yourself with one just in case.	1
This floating betta mirror is great for the bettas.  They enjoy looking at themselves. It's great to watch them play	0
these 2 saw blades are well worth you money if your looking for a good buy.  i do alot of wood working building bird houses and feeders and other yard pieces.  they cut extremely clean and last a long time.	0
My 3 year old niece practically rolled on the floor laughing when we played together with this toy. It was an amazing day.	1
We moved to a small condo and had to downsize on everything, including dining room furniture.  We needed something clean, crisp, and smallish, but still wanted sturdy, functional, and pretty.  Found it all in these wonderful chairs.  They come 2 to a bundle, and we bought white.  They came packaged incredibly well, wrapped in plastic forming a square cube.  It took my husband and me about 20 minutes to unwrap, assemble, and dispose of the packaging -- a pretty successful feat for us!  The chairs are really nice looking, offer strong support, and look wonderful.  We're both on the tall side  (5.7 and 5.11) and not small people, and they fit us well.  We've gone from those big wooden, heavy, padded dining chairs to these light yet fully supportive chairs and are happy about the change.  We paired our chairs with Monarch Specialties Chrome Metal Tempered Glass Dining Table (40&#34;) and they work great together.  The words I'd use for the look are modern, European, minimalist, cool.  In addition, comfy too.	0
I got a 4 ounce bag of these through a subscription box service and it was a challenge not to eat the whole bag in one sitting (each serving is one ounce).<br /><br />First, since there's currently not much product information on the page (including no &#34;Nutrition Facts&#34; box):<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Quinoa (Whole Grain Quinoa, Quinoa Flakes, Quinoa Crisps), Peanuts, Tapioca Syrup, Raw Sugar, Crystallized Ginger (Ginger, Cane Sugar), Honey, Brown Rice Crisps, Almond Oil, Baking Soda, Salt<br /><br />These are gluten free (certified) but obviously not vegan (honey). This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).<br /><br />Texture-wise, these are very similar to the hard/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1/2 inch square (not quite 1/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).<br /><br />Maybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious. I'd definitely consider buying these in the future (as well as looking for other flavors from the same company).	0
Unfortunately it got all rusty in less that 6 month after I purchased it. Good pull up bars seem to be really hard to find in general as it seems. I've tried several models by now and all were disappointing. I was hoping the York one would be better but to no avail. Would be nice if they actually offer different models in various price ranges, I would rather spend 50 pounds once than 10 pounds every year.	1
Excited by results of this product- makes my skin more youthful looking!<br />This is so good I want to use it everyday. The results were amazing, plus I know that it not only is making my skin look better and younger then ever it is helping repair old damage and keeping new damage from happening! Seeing such great results already so I wait to see how this effect will look after a couple of months of using!	1
I have had the older versions of Need for Speed and this is by far the best.  I was having a hard time using this with Kinect.  This is awesome with XBOX.  I love racing I do motor cross myself and on days I don't race, I still race at home.	1
The router we got was NOT the shape that we expected! It cut into grooves a lot more than what is shown and described. Its not the right size i believe.	1
Excellent watch. So beautiful !!! Excellent conditions, just as described. I'm very happy about this purchase... Aaaand I need more words to add a comment so here it is &#62;.&#62;	0
I bought this for my 2 year old grandson and he absolutely Loves it! I love that it comes with the Android 4.0 Operating system and pre-loaded with applications and games. easy to use, he can use it himself and he loves it! I highly recommend it.	1
I bought this for my daughter because, of course, she wants to be Elsa for Halloween. She has already worn it once, and there will be many more times. It's made relatively well--doesn't tear easily--and it was great for the price!	0
I was starting to feel alienated by all the new and unfamiliar Pokémon when this one came along. A lot of the older ones are here and I feel like playing a totally new game with a few of my old pals.	1
I have 2 sun conures and they have tons of room to play and fly in this cage! Could be a little stronger on the legs and more bottom storage.	1
I installed this product cause I heard that this is what I needed. I bought it off of their website. It worked at first but then stopped working. Then this ridiculous seller told me that I probably damaged it somehow when I was trying to figure out what went wrong and said I would have to purchase a new one. Do not buy from him! he does not stand behind his product.	1
Nice, big plastic clips.  Very easy to work with and get a grip on.  I do no think they are made to be Heavy duty clips.  But will certainly hold 20 or 30 pieces of paper together.  Also, good for book marking.  And, they are pretty and fun to look at.  I am very happy with mine!!!!!	0
Pretty incredible little knife for the money. It's more of the same &#34;bang for your buck&#34; that Sanrenmu is famous for. The can opener also works well as a cap lifter (I've cracked open a few brews with it with no problems). The liners are skeleton-ized, and the scales are textured with a honeycomb pattern for excellent grip. The belt cutter tool is extremely sharp, and cuts through 550 paracord like its not even there. I haven't tried the glass breaker yet, but it seems sharp and strong enough to do the job. The recurved blade is good at pulling the work into the belly to make short work of rope and fibrous materials. Locks up like a bank vault, and the liner lock is jimped for easy disengagement. The pocket clip is tip-down only, but with the glass breaker on the other end, this makes perfect sense. The pocket clip carries deep and has excellent retention.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this little knife, especially at the price point.	0
Duke's Mayonnaise is delicious. We thought we would try it to see if  there was a real difference from other brands.<br />There is. It is creamy, more flavorful and enhances the taste of any food needing mayonnaise.<br />It is definitely better than the regular grocery store brands and we will purchase Duke's again.<br />~ The Boss and Mrs. B.	0
great Pigflytech 4K Smart TV BOX, 3D-HD Blu-ray Streaming Media Player,only shortcoming is the remote but that seems to be the case with all of the boxes. extremely easy to use by anyone familiar with android and kodi/xbmc has plenty of videos and tutorials that can be found online. basically turns any tv into a smart tv and media center. I still say this is a great box but the fire is all around even better.	1
I get a lot of compliments on this necklace. Love it! I might replace the chain though, my skin is a little sensitive to the one it cane with. But its really not that big of a deal. I still love this necklace.	0
Excellent product,I have been in search of a similar innovative product from past so many months.Easy to use and easy to carry,take selfies anywhere very easily without any hustle.It also helps me to use my phone like a professional camera,being able to capture rare moments of birds and animals with easy.The 34&#34; long BLUETOOTH stick makes everything possible plus the convenient button at the other end makes it even more useful and portable.Moreover it is compatible with every android phone and Iphones of course.AMAZING.....HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!	1
Exactly as described, springy rotation on the catches, and a handy gift/display box so I don't lose them when they're off.	1
Gets hot and delivers alot of glue. I would recommend it for big jobs where you want the glue to stick forever.	0
I was very impressed with this product. Did an excellent job of conditioning the leather. Leaves leather very hydrated and extremely soft, even removes surface scratches. Make sure you wipe off any excess after the conditioner has completely soaked in, even if you can't see it, otherwise the surface will feel very sticky. Looks like honey and feels like honey, especially if you don't wipe down after soaking in. Leather Honey lasts much longer than any other product I have used, 4-6 months with normal use. The only drawback is the leather will darken quite a bit. Not a problem on black leather but your light browns will turn to dark brown after you apply. If you want to preserve the color I recommend Bick 4. Doesn't last as long or hydrate the leather as well as Leather Honey but it will not darken the leather but a very very small amount. Bick 4 on my light colored leather and Lucchese ostrich boots, Leather Honey on everything else. Also, go for the 16 oz bottle of Leather Honey, you will use it.	0
This DVD rocks. totally entertaining and instructive. My 5 year old loves it. I will buy it again without thinking twice. nice	1
Excellent TV! REally pleased with it. The picture is sharp, tv is fast, and it really looks good! Now thats what i call HD! even the sound is excellent.. Couldnt ask more from a TV. And its price is really fair, you wont be disappointed.	1
I love tea!  I've actually become a bit of a tea snob.  I find it challenging to purchase tea online, without being able to smell and see it in person.  I took a chance on this organic black tea.  I was not disappointed.  It's delicious!  Very robust and fragrant.  It steeps well and the blend is wonderful.  I'm so glad to have found this gem!	0
The foot of the boot did not fit correctly so we were unable to use them in my boots. Otherwise, quality seemed good.	0
In my opinion, Tim Hortons makes the best coffee at the best price. I also love the Chocolate and the Cappuccino mix! In fact, the whole family loves all Tim Hortons beverage mixes..especially the kids (chocolate). How we wish a Tim Hortons cafe will open in our place but for now, thanks, Amazon, for having Tim Horton products available for us! :)	1
The shipping was quick, but the bags only lasted a few days. A bag broke after it hit the corner of the board so I had to sew it back up. A few days later, I had the same thing happen again and eventually just gave up on them.	1
I always needed these extensions and my friend recently bought me this! I just simply love it because I need to charge my laptops and phone close to me and this is the best way. I am just glad that it has many outlets especially when I am in college.	1
I love this product because it makes the best appletini's ever.  A local restaurant makes the best appletini's and the bartender shared this syrup with me.  My appletini-lovin' friends (who can be hard to please) really like it.	0
I don't smoke or anything so I am unsure why my case is now a yellow color. Extremely disappointing.	1
I received 1 can for the purpose of this review.  It is therefore necessary to assume that all cans are consistently the same.  The primary ingredients are cooked beans and water, but lesser ingredients include salt, tomato paste, chili pepper, sugar, natural flavor, and yeast extract. Wonder what those natural flavors might be. The directions are to heat on the stove-top or covered in a microwavable bowl.  Leftovers should be refrigerated.  The can I received in April, 2015 had a date of 16 Jan 2017.	0
When you get these you will understand what I am talking about.  They are not Hospital Grade nor are they the product that is in the picture.  No matter how many people submit the same complaint......it does not get corrected.  It can only mean this company is clearly trying to deceive everyone with this product.  They are diapers....but they are NOT what I was expecting for quality.  They seem like cheap knock offs.  I have one package of original  Pampers Swaddlers that I bought from Sams Club and a few diapers left over from what the hospital gave me......the ones from Amazon are a lot cheaper...looking and feeling.  They are about half as thick and do not seem like they will absorb as much.  I have watched the price bounce from $.17-.22 at Sams Club.  Do yourself a favor and buy the originals found in the store. For just pennys more each diaper....it will be worth it.	0
Love this necklace!!! My daughter is almost a year and just in the last month and half she got her first 8 teeth. She is an excessive drooler. I put this on every morning and no more drooling till I take it off at night. She also seems to be happier from not being in much teething pain.	0
The product i received does not have the &#34;melissa and doug&#34; writing, comes in 21 pieces instead of the supposed 25 pieces and has blue base plate instead of the light beech colour. I wonder if this is melissa and doug product at all.<br /><br />The workmanship is bad. The pieces chips off posing danger for my toddler. The paint is not even.<br /><br />The product i received is totally not as depicted in the picture and product specification. I'm very disappointed at this purchase	0
I can't say I cared for the price of these balls (seemed high) but they are truly made of quality. I debated on other brands and sites that were cheaper and also looked in store. If you want something that will last and not dent up then buy these! 200 balls is NO WHERE near what you'd think... It takes A TON of balls to add up to much of anything. Great product!	0
This is my second pair, great price, adorable glasses. I get compliments all the time. I'll be ordering more, maybe in all the colors.	0
fits great and the sizes are very acurate. It is nicely made and I would highly recommend it. Have not worn is much so can't attest to it's wear factor yet.	1
These tubes were mailed to me from the UK and took over 2 weeks for me to receive them. From the description, I thought these were specifically for Graco wheels. However, they are just standard innertubes. The print on the side reads "Duro - 16x1.75, 47-305 HBD, made in Thailand". I could have purchased a similar generic innertube locally for much less.    I have not yet installed the new tube to fix my rear stroller flat, but if they don't work, I certainly will be looking elsewhere for a replacement tube. Not worth the money or the wait!!!	0
Hard to be more pleased with what I received, there really is not much to quibble about.<br /><br />It's true the accents are more purple than red, especially when viewed at night with indoor light. With  sunlight illuminating them from the rear however, they do take on a more reddish hue.<br /><br />No problems on length or alignment of the panels -- something I was given to worrying about when reading experiences of others.<br /><br />Quality is just what I expected, they are thick enough to be durable and to sufficiently filter light to provide some privacy -- but a sheer curtain behind them or window blinds will really be needed for complete privacy.<br /><br />I hung mine highest to the ceiling in front of a bedroom window under which my bed sits for maximum effect -- this does mean that there is a difference of illumination in the daytime -- with the top half looking somewhat like a storm clearing in the late afternoon or early morning.<br /><br />The colors do wash out somewhat if you do not have blinds or a sheer curtain behind them in the daytime  -- but with something additional to filter the light the effect is rather one of illumination -- very nice indeed.<br /><br />The type of indoor lighting you have at night will modify the hues somewhat, but I don't see this as a problem for anyone, that's just a natural thing with all colors.<br /><br />It's hard to see how anyone could be disappointed with the purchase, barring some manufacturing defect or quality control issue.	0
OMG this is the best Mario Kart ever. It's worth getting the new console if you don't already have it. And will new and upcoming downloadable content, tracks, racers, etc - it's longevity will last. The best is playing with friends online.	0
My fiancée bought me this ring as our engagement ring. The proposal was a bit of disappointment. He wanted to put it on the saucer so when I will be asking for a sauce, I would see it and I will be surprise. Yet the ring was served on a wrong table and the one in there got mad because of the ring. My fiancée ran on the table and grabbed it. He gave it to me with frustration and asked me if i will marry him with a frustrated face. I got mad and told him to ask me again on a good way. He shouted, &#34;Mary, you are my life, my everything. I don't think I will be able to live another second without you beside me when i am going to sleep and if i can't see your face when I wake up. Can you please share a lifetime with me?&#34; Everyone was shocked and touched by what he said. Who am i to say no, right. This is such a great ring by the way. The best ring for me. :)	1
My brother has one of this and we always play music with it. It has a good sound quality. I am planning to buy one for myself. Great just great.	1
I have looked in so many stores and I have not had any luch finding the right bowls for cereal and soups. I'm so happy I cam across these they also make very nice salad bowls. Just what I needed for my hungry family.	1
Purchased for my mother, she has long been a fan of the titanic, this necklace was the perfect costume piece to add to her other titanic replica jewelry.	0
At last, a metric-only version of Snap-on's small 3/8&#34; socket set! This is a beautiful set and will serve the needs of almost any normal user. Just get it! Williams socket sets like this are identical to the Blue-point sets that Snap-on trucks sell.	0
Bought it for my dad as a Christmas present and he likes it.<br /><br />Works well, haven't had any problems with it (bought it 4 years ago).	0
The bag is Awesome. I'm a 25 YO man and had failed to really find  a reggae masculine bag for my regular outings with my boys. This is inexpensive yet great quality , nice thick leather .Just perfectly meets my needs!<br /> I can't complaint about anything!<br />Im sure if I go to some store They'd ask me for a month's salary for this bag LOL.	1
I've seen these over the years and always wanted a set to help stop the rocking of our 5th wheel. This was, by far, the best price and standard shipping was great. I also like the quick release feature as it saves TONS of time. This was something that I didn't see on other chocks. The price on these is incredible and the are very well built. I hope you enjoy these as much as I have!	1
Purchased it from another place but I am impressed with its action so I needed to leave a review here. It stopped the itch and the scaly dandruff. It's not as drying as some of the other products.	1
I really like these sunglasses. They look really nice and are made from good material (Which I was kinda skeptical about). I don't know why people spend so much money on Rayban's and Oakley's. These are just fine and are really cheap.	1
My 14 year old son loves this shirt.  Wears it every chance he can get.  It washes well and comes out of the dryer wrinkle free.  I would recommend this shirt.	0
Printer will not print the color red.  All other colors print very light, not dark and bold as with our old printer of this exact same model.	0
This product works just as specified, I am very satisfied with it and would recommend it to anyone looking for a well crafted item	0
My pups are happy with this and I think that that's what matter in the end. The price is pretty hard to beat too.	1
I have been a long time customer of Todd's Seeds and these organic alfalfa seeds are right up there with the organic broccoli seeds they sell. First, it's amazing how many seeds come in the one pound bag. Second, it's really amazing how many sprouts you can get out of just a few tablespoons of seed!<br /><br />Most people do not realize that because they are so small, the alfalfa sprouts contain a concentrated amount of certain vitamins and minerals such as calcium, vitamin K and vitamin C. Alfalfa sprouts contain just 8 calories and 0 grams of fat per cup. We eat these alone, and on our sandwiches. We like the Todd's Seeds brand because he sent us a copy of the laboratory testing they do to verify no pathogens, ecoli, etc. You need good seeds to get good sprouts!	1
My original adapter burnt out after a month and felt which really annoyed me because I had got it at a higher price compared to this one. I had to look for another one since my evenings couldn't be complete without a game or two. On viewing the advert on amazon, i read some of the reviews and finally made up my mind to go for this adapter. In a few days, i had the adapter at hand and has been well satisfied by the good work it does.	1
This is a really good olive oil. It's one of the best olive oils I have ever tried, and if you are somebody who appreciates a good one, this is it.	1
My daughter loves this DS game, but has commented that the online computer version is more fun because more options are available.	0
Husband had me order three of these for his job site.  He says they work WAY better than the $500 radios the customer uses.  He reports they are SUPER easy to use as well as amazing distance.  So far, they are also standing up to heavy use with reliable and good battery life.	0
Excellent Build Quality, Packing and feel..!! Premium Style..!! who so ever saw it on my wrist asked me about it...!! What more can I say? Go for it without thinking..!!	1
Works great , light weight and straighten in seconds to full length. Big bonus that the nozzle was added ,great buy..	0
This carrying bag worked out great. It held everything I needed and then a little bit more. Th extra outer pockets wre perfect for other items. Construction feels strong. It held up through much airport abuse. All in all it was a great buy!	0
Great tool for checking setups when working on your guitars or looking at one to buy, you will be better informed than just eyeballing it!	0
LOVE THIS STONE!!!.<br />This is a beautiful pendulum!.. All of the stones and Pendulums that I have received from this company has been in GREAT condition and is made real well. Feels great against the body.	0
I've been looking for some custom Xbox One modded controllers for quite some time now, and I've come across quite a few of them, but this one caught my eye. In person the product looks so much better than the photo. The gold really shines and is a nice color, the back of the controller is black, but it looks very clean and sleek. Only downside is the fingerprints which are easy to remove with a cloth, I even bought a case to protect my controller as I'm so in love with it.<br /><br />The mods work PERFECT. They are activated using the d-pad, which at first I thought might mess me up in game but surprisingly its easy to use, and quick to activate. I have yet to accidentally enable a mod in game. Rapid fire works great as do all the other add ons, I was surprised at how great the mod worked considering the console has not been out very long but no complaints here! Works great on COD Ghosts and Titanfall. Going to be picking up a few of the other chrome colors that Geniusmods offers.	1
I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a &#34;sex only - no strings attached&#34; common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.<br /><br />The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since &#34;Ghostbusters&#34; in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.<br /><br />The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...<br /><br />I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34;, &#34;The Guardian&#34;, &#34;My boss's daughter&#34; and &#34;A lot like love&#34;) and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of &#34;Notting Hill&#34;, &#34;While you were sleeping&#34;, &#34;When Harry meets Sally&#34; or &#34;Must love dogs&#34; - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of &#34;A lot like love&#34; (a lesser, albeit honest film). I am glad that I rented it instead of buying. AVOID!	0
I'd suggest that this is not for beginners. More for the intermediate musician. It is not something you are going to understand at first. The learning curve is moderate. Other than that, quite useful and durable.	0
It may be bad karma to complain, but these are smaller than I expected. That's partly my fault; I thought the flags I got before were 4" x 5" but they were at least 6" x 6". And it's partly the vendor's fault. These are advertised as 4" x 5", but I found them to be at most 4" x 4" and, measured from the string, less than 4". 5 strings barely stretches 20 feet. Still, they were right for a space I had and you get 100 flags for $8. But for outside my house, I would go lots bigger next time.	0
Correct me if I am wrong but this bag easily could cost 2 times more. I went for shopping several weeks ago and similar bags cost a lot more on the highstreet.	1
If only the image quality was better in not-so-well-lit-situations, it's a five star. Definitely the coolest gadget I ever had for years.	0
Great overall,The straps are durable and very comfortable, because the design that distribute the weight of  the backpack very evenly,  it very fit physical activities such as hiking or biking.	1
Very loud and the foot pedal does not work right, when I press to start sewing it won't go, and when I stop it still wants to run, very aggravating, Got this machine to do my quilting on and it doesn't hardly want to pull fabric thru. Wish I could get money back. Very disappointed.	1
I've seen the Numark many a times in the store and online. Based on reviews from this site and others I didn't believe other consumer's experience until I had an opportunity to play and create a mix. Finally, last month I was able to mess around with the Numark Mixdeck.It's just WOW! I had 2 USB flashdrives, installed my mp3s on unit. It was easy to go through tracks as if physically I thumb through LPs. Every Mp3 was alphabetized when I searched for track to cue from deck to another deck. Anyone that knows how to beatmatch can easily pick up on a mix once getting to familiarize the units keys and features.	1
This is too large for a typical business use. It is wider than it needs to be and is not convenient for professional use. US Pad is much better.	0
These worked great<br />Mounted on the wall and the paper roles hang great<br />Going to buy another set to put above these<br />I used a 2&#34; dia pvc to roll a backdrop on and put it on the bottom row<br />Worked great	0
the actual product is not matched with the description and product screenshot.<br /> Description and product screenshot: cases expand for added packing capacity.<br /> Actual product: no added packing capacity.<br /><br />cheated by the screenshot.	0
Makes my DVD's look good on the HD TV.  If you are just looking for something to play DVD's this is a good choice.	1
Todo muy gracias, el regalo de mis ahijados... esta perfecto para ellos y toda la familia.. .. . . . .	0
I bought this trilogy for my granddaughter. She loved the original disks but she & the rest of the family are enjoying it now on blue- ray. Clearer visually & perhaps improved sound.	0
These thing are great for the price. They could use a bit more bass but Im a basshead, I think it would be totally satisfactory for someone thats not. The mids, highs and clarity are great. Theyre so good at times I think theyre better than my amped DT770s save for the bass of course.	0
We are a plumbing company in Reno, NV and install these in water heater pans when the installation is in a location that is not always monitored.  The local governing entities (inspectors) like the added security feature as well.	0
Really good microphones for the price. Easy to use, it comes with a solid and and well designed protector case. I was looking for such wireless mic for my house party. Both microphones work well. I have tried about 30 feet long. I found the Clean sound. Very easy to use and transport. I am happy with this microphone set. Now I always use this for my house party. It's really too good. Highly recommended.	1
We love this chair. Best value on They. Very well constructed and assembled in 10 minutes. This is our second purchase for a new location. Our staff finds this chair much more comfortable and the quality is great....overall a very heavy duty chair for the money. Highly recommended.	1
These have been my favorite pencils since I was a kid, no other pencil can help me write so neat and perfect.	1
I LOVE this product. This is my 3erd strap Natgeo. I use in one Nikon D800 and D300s. I use a LOT my cameras and in the Caribbean. Put some rubber in the camera to prevent marks in the body.	0
My son loved this toy, which was one of his Christmas presents. Its really good quality and goes over small obstacles and inclines with ease. I've bought other cheap R/C cars from ebay before but they don't last. This one runs really well and we get quite a decent run out of one set of batteries. Loads of fun and great value for money.	1
I use this filter on all my vehicles, and it works remarkable. It is truly a HIGH PERFORMANCE oil filter that works well.	1
I bought this for OSX 10.6 use, but the package is 100% silent on same. The Amazon page mentions the ASIX AX88772 chipset which *does* have a driver available from ASIX, but Sabrent did themselves no favor by their packaging label. Other brands of  choices for USB-Ethernet do let you know.	0
This seems cruel but with the scare of dengue I had to do something. No chemicals that can harm me or my pet. Scares me every time it zaps but works well. The only thing is that the plug is weird and the gadget needs to be supported while charging. Charge last a long time and the fact that is re-chargeable is way better that batteries.	1
I found this item on Amazon.com. This is the best price That I found, plus no tax, and freight also. So get a good item at a fair price.  SW	0
Complete CRAP! I needed this to shoot some videos and after following the instructions and inserting the batteries I turned on the switch and BAM - nothing happened. I tried 5 different devices with different outputs. I even watched videos to make sure I am doing everything correctly. Simply did not work! I even used the microphone separately on my phone and it still didn't work. Honestly you don't even get what you pay for! Total s*** and I had to return it for a full refund and go for something else.	0
My dad ordered this for himself and he's been complaining about it ever since. He says that it was flimsy and difficult to use for cutting. I'm just echoing his opinion.	1
First of all, let me admit that I didn't necessarily need a region-free player.  What I DID need was a reliable DVD player that could upconvert my extensive DVD collection to 1080p, and do it WELL!  This player did not disappoint me.  My DVD's now look absolutely gorgeous through this player, and that's important to me because my DVD collection is quite extensive and I'm not willing to replace them all with blu-ray versions (and of course some of my favorite DVD's aren't even available on blu-ray yet.)  So if you're like me and all you need is a good solid player with stellar upconversion, this is the player for you!  Bravo, Pioneer!	0
An outstanding gift idea for ladies.  HIgh quality material and created by expert hands... very smooth and while delicate and intricate, is sturdy as well.  I love the beautiful designs too... a great value for a product of the highest quality... very highly recommended!	1
In my opinion this is a good start to a system.<br /><br />This is fine for a bedroom or smaller sized living area. This will not replace your surround sound system. The wattage rating and speaker size reinforces this point. That being said, the quality of the tower is up to par.<br /><br />* Quality enclosure<br />* No assembly required<br />* iPod mates to tower<br />* Remote mates to iPod<br />* Secure line Jacks<br />* MP3 Aux-in Jack<br />* FM radio with 20 preset<br />* Composite video output<br /><br />These are all good working features and those without functional glitches.<br /><br />An area that could be improved:<br /><br />AM stations seem to be non-existent. Perhaps FM stations are only received.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />The tower is priced well and the quality of the audio is very good. We purchased the tower for our sons room and in that space the tower works well.	1
This watch was exactly as I was led to expect by the description and the details about it. It's good with practically anything I have and it tells time accurately. What more can I really ask for other than those?	1
Received this just today and it looks really good. A bit short (I am 5'6). Way too flimsy to be used as a cane or walking stick. Attractive design and will keep the rain and sun off.	0
Don't get me wrong, the doll was mauled. My dog murdered this thing. I expected that though since she really loves to tear things to pieces. What I'm surprised by was how long the doll actually lasted.	1
This game is incredible.<br /><br />You play as a woman who is barefoot on a hospital bed.<br /><br />She uses her machine to kill other enemies.<br /><br />This is GAME OF THE YEAR and one of the only good games to come out this year.<br /><br />This makes more cry 4, dragonBORING inquisition and dancing female 2 look like trash.<br /><br />6/6 stars.	0
This isn't anything special. They're just fine. My nieces appreciate them though, so I suppose I can't really complain.	1
My cat did not like this at all, I would think 1 star is just harsh to give a product and 3 star is decent enough so that is what I gave. My cat just smelled it and moved on.	1
It is a comfortable case, enough space for the camera, besides it has pockets that enable you store many useful things.	1
Do you want to know my favorite feature of this inflatable? It's how fast this thing sets up! It's amazing. Get it started and within one minute it's fully blown up and the kids are ready to start bouncing!	1
My daughter wanted these for sports and she loves them. they let her feet breath and give her great support. The color is bright and they are stitched well. great shoes thanks	1
I didn't realize that this amp would run into distortion when I turn it up to more than around 5 Watts. This amp is advertised as a 30 Watt amp. The actual specs are far from that figure. Very disappointed especially after reading all of those positive reviews.	1
Much better than the factory 3-D glasses that came with my Panasonic Plasma. Easy to pair, comfortable, and comes with a case and cloth!	0
I bought this on my first hiking adventure and I didn't regret it in buying this "Everest Hiking Pack". The materials used on this product are very durable. I and my friend can attest on this on the multiple major scratches during our trails but it didn't cut off.  What I love most on this backpack is that with affordable price you can buy it and you have a bag that can fit clothes for days. More adventure to come with my mighty hiking pack!	1
I am glad that I bought this bag. It has a lot of room, adjustable straps, comes in multiple colors and it fits my style. Do not how it would do in the washer, so I just wipe it down if dirty. My boyfriend sometimes use it as a motocycle bag when he's driving across town. Very useful!	0
Thats a great skike for beginners. I recently switched to the vo8 model. Great quality and authentic feeling to ride them.	1
I bought these for my 7 year old and she loves them.  She said they are comfortable and they look super on her.  I love them so much I will buy them in white for myself for everyday.  Lovely product!	0
The USB760 3G provided my laptop with internet exactly as expected.  Then I plugged it into my firewall and it provides a backup internet for my company. So when the very fast and cheap internet from the cable company goes down, I have a slow way to communicate (BUT I CAN COMMUNICATE).	0
I did all my Christmas shopping early. I know that my nephew will love this toy. I couldn't help it and I had to put the batteries in and try it out (I never give gifts without batteries) and so I tried it out and I know he will love it. This is the perfect gift for a 10 year old boy. Thank you Amazon.	1
17.3 laptop fits perfectly in it (without case- I do not have one). Can hold many books and other peripheral items. Well constructed	0
It is a great multi-tool.<br />The material is also durable and provides a variety of tools.<br />Case also seems pretty good also as a gift.<br />Easy portability have liked to attend.<br />I will recommend to my friends.	1
For the price, I wasn't expecting much, but I was pleasantly surprised.  I purchased this as a present for a friend...I am not a Patriots fan...and she loves it.  The quality of the painting, which is the most important thing, was really good.  Very happy.	0
The optics clarity was not. Ever close to what I expected from them. The optics is closer to what I would expect from fisher price. Bottom line they are over priced for what you get.	1
Exactly what I needed for long trips. However. I would of been happy to pay more if a car charger to come with it. Nearly impossible to buy a Micca car charger  from anywhere. I ended up having to make one after several failed purchases.	0
I was able to set the 4 digit tumblers and insert the cable. Cannot get the cable head back out. I tried scrambling the numbers, returning to the combination I set and nothing. It doesn't unlock.<br /><br />I had planned to use this item on a European train trip to lock my luggage. I cannot depend on it to possibly work. Please give me instructions on how to return for a full refund ($10.48).<br /><br />I sent this email to the company the day I received it (April 4, 2014). As of this posting I have heard Nothing from the company.	0
This is absolutely my favorite watch.  I own two others that I got for basically the same price, and this is by far the highest quality.  This watch keeps perfect time, and the indiglo feature is surprisingly useful.  The only problem with this watch is that the ticking is very loud.  It's actually annoyed a few people around me, but I don't mind it.  The replaceable strap is useful because I can make my watch look completely different based off what strap I'm using.  I use a leather nato strap to dress the watch up, and I have several different colored nylon straps to go with different outfits.	0
This is not a stand alone remedy for getting fleas. This however is a good  added measure in between spraying your house and bathing your pooch. You will see the fleas inside in a couple of days, proof that it does work.	1
I got this for my nephew and he loves it so much he's always clutching it under his arms and can't go to bed without it. It is soft and just feels good to cuddle. I love it too.	1
This is a lovingly researched and professionally edited 2 DVD set giving the ultimate overview of the life and career of the great Leonard Cohen. Unlike many of these type programs this one DOES have plenty of LC's music and performance footage, and even some LC interviews (albeit archive ones)  If you aren't ever going to get around to reading one of the breeze-block sized biographies (none of which, as far as I'm aware are sanctioned or have any contribution from Leonard himself) then this will do the job nicely. And if you have read everything, time to get a little less academic less and chill out in front of the this very decent 3.5 hour documentary.	1
When my boyfriend received his In the mail the box was smashed. People are thinking &#34;big whop its a toy&#34; NO its a collectible!! If I'm paying $59.95 on something I'd only hope someone wouldn't send it damage and won't do nothing about it!	0
I've really enjoyed using this treatment from the moment it was delivered. Easy to apply, smells really nice, doesn't leave my hair feeling heavy or slimy despite the oils in it—in general, this treatment turned out to be perfect for me. It takes effect on hair regrowth after a while, but I like it so much I barely noticed the weeks fly by.	1
This product has palm oil in it, and as far as "vegetable" oils are concerned its one of the worst oils around. Yes, I suppose the palm oil is natural, but it's a saturated fat and it's NOT healthy. It also has added sugar. Other brands might be a better choice for health conscious consumers as it has only two ingredients, peanuts and salt.	1
This product looks great, has a lot of very practical features (like push-button loading and a tray for storing staples), and does it's job very well. My wife and I really like it and I'm sure she will find many uses for it in her classroom. This is the first Rapesco product I have owned. I was not familiar with this brand before trying this product. I am impressed with the quality of this product and would highly recommend it to others.	0
I was surprised at the level of quality of the lenses and frame. They are cute and are actually non-polarized which is rare to find in a product this inexpensive. Shades are dark and sleek.	1
Perfect for car trips. I didn't want to use my larger airplane travel suit bag for trips when driving my car. I used to use the free bags that the give you when you purchase the suit. They don't work well and look bad. This is very professional looking and easy to use. I love that it is not super long like other garment bags. Just the right size for a mans suit or sport coat. Plenty of room.	0
I was a bit worried since a lot of reviews on coffee presses talked about thin glass/breaking with hot water...Im not sure what could make it better, because the grinds do come through as well as the really fine grounds. Not a whole lot, but I just pour it through a coffee filter and all is good. Im not sure if all coffee presses let though a few grounds. The only down side for me is there wasn't any measurement on the glass to see how much water I was pouring in. I just broke out my black sharpie and fixed that. Good enough product.	0
Plair was a great Christmas gift. It's easy to use and works well to watch my favorite shows. I can watch almost anything on the internet. Also, the remote control on the app is a great feature. I own a few other competitor products and find Plair to be the most user friendly and all encompassing. It's an awesome product!	1
Great pair of thermal pants, the elastic is phenomenal and secure, the length is just right, and the material is adequate for moderately cold climates.  So far, one of the better long underpants I have found on amazon. No complaints on the pants, the top however (if you decide to purchase its mate) is not equally as satisfactory due to the fact that there is an obtrusive hard paper tag :| Other than that, spectacular buy!	0
I have several pair of this shoe and will be sad when they discontinue it! These are extremely comfortable and wear well with both shorts and long pants.	0
Great! I prescribe this for those of us who are not mechanics. As an old &#34;shade tree repairman&#34; I understood left with the new innovation generally demonstrate autos. With this instrument I am back aware of present circumstances and feel certain when investigating issues. Extremely proficient judgment and repairs are conceivable in addition to you can verify whether the repairs you make, do indeed, rectify your problem.	1
Little important documents are in good hands in this neck pouch. Pulling out passports, credit cards and money bills will never be a hassle. The adjustable clip on the neck string also allows me to wear it the way I prefer. With a cheap price, it's such a treat!	1
I love running and this waist pack is just what I need. Also very durable and fits perfectly in my waist.	1
Love this show *-*  Story line is a little cheesy at times, but the actors fit the characters just right...very funny...I'm in absolute love with all of them!<br /><br />Love as always,<br />~Heather	1
If you want a light rope, this is for you, but I was looking for weight as well a sparkle. The color and sparkle on this one does not hold up very long. I wore it for about a week and already the color was changing to gray.	1
i love that it zips up to a compact size. i actually bought 2 of these, 1 for each of my sons for our family vacation coming up. i was not expecting them to be so roomy, they could probably share 1 bag.	1
I keep cleaning my terrarium.  I always use this sand, I still have a lot of this left. Truly a great deal. You get so much product to the price.	1
item looks nothin like the picture. just a long piece of cheap plastic that bends and doesnt do anything useful	1
My husband has it in his head to try to connect with nature and this book is a great source of fun for him to read. I don't really expect him to do anything crazy, but if he does, he'll be prepared.	1
I bought this starter cause the dude in a previous review said it worked on his 98 Dodge Durango ...same vehicle I have....works good.....I will update this review if any problems occur	0
My older sister had her second baby almost a year ago and this seemed like an appropriate costume for his first Halloween party. When she saw it, my sister got really chirpy and tried it on the little guy right away.	1
What is not to like about a portable device that comes with its own small carrying bag that can be used as a mouse or as a trackball that can be used on a surface or held in one hand when no surface is available.  It has held up well despite getting knocked around while being transported.  My only complaint is that it is too easy to accidentally click on the buttons; this issue is easily solved by holding with fingers farther down than buttons, it is easy to move fingers up to buttons when they need to be clicked as well as easy to move fingers back down and off when done.  Update: Lasted about a year.	0
I have all Samsung Equipment due to the sharing among devices.  I would recommend this monitor who is looking for monitor.  I wish it has the picture in picture for the same price.<br /><br />However, I love it.	0
This made it through the first kid, but now due to the wire at the top getting bent by opening and closing, it's deformed and much less useful. I'm going with the Britax organizer which I suspect will do better with repeated use on our Britax stroller.	0
This is a very cute mailbox that matches perfectly with my barn theme. I purchased the red barn. The mailbox is made very well. I am sure I will get many years use out of it.	1
This is a very handy little tuner with one small issue.  Occasionally, it takes several re-clamps before it starts picking up pitch.  It's a tiny annoyance for an otherwise good product.	0
It's pretty, but I didn't realize it was a &#34;silk&#34; type material. I was expecting it to be a cotton blend. It is very easy to put on, and it does look nice. BE PREPARED TO IRON IT as soon as you receive it!! No way would I put it on my bed in the condition it was in after removing from the package. It was so wrinkled and messy.. but it ironed easy and hangs very nice on our bed. I can't use a standard skirt as we have a type of platform bed, so this hangs nicely over the rail. I am unable to use the foot section due to our bed style, but you can't tell with our bed as the headboard goes to the ground. So this skirt system works wonderfully for use with platform beds or beds with side rails.	0
The ones I received were not all different colors as pictured. Luckiy, I am a girl and don't mind all the purple and pink!	1
I was surprised at the sound quality of these speakers. You expect this kind of sound from more expensive speakers. I bought these speakers because of the reviews. I was not disappointed, it has nice bass, i actually hear sounds that i didn't hear from the more expensive speakers i had. I would recommend these speakers.	1
I'm very happy with this photo frame. It's very convenient to put my files on a USB Flash Drive and just plug that into the photo frame. The frame discovers all the JPEGs on the flash drive, even if they're in folders and subfolders. The screen is bright and clear. The menu system and remote control are easy to use, and the short manual which comes with it is good too.	0
I think the word &#34;pad&#34; is a little misleading here.  This mouse pad does not have the black foam padding on the bottom of it.  It's pretty much just a super thin piece of plastic.  I like the puppy picture I just wish the pad had some sort of grip foam on the bottom side.	0
Wouldn't recommend.  Tried one of these, had three right in a row that went out.  Went back to WD myself.	1
This attachment carries the vibration very well that it felt like the vibration spread throughout the attachment giving a very good stimulation. Great!	1
I bought this about 3 weeks ago and I love it. Taste wise, its not the best but the pill is easy to swallow.  It is not a magic pill so you need to do some exercise.  Just try cutting back on how much you eat. Add a banana for a snack , or serve yourself the regular amount that you usually would and then cut it down the middle and only eat half.  Remember to drink a lot of water during the day. And lastly eat a great breakfast!  Cut out the pop!  If you try eating small snacks during the day to keep your metabolism constantly working fast... You will shed the pounds ;) Hope this helped-	1
I had high hopes with the reviews, unfortunately my German Shorthair Pointer figured it out and as I thought she would...eventually just barked and barked through the sound I suppose. Had brand new Duracell batteries and light was green.  At first it seemed to work but then, with Separation Anxiety kicking in....she did not care.  Too late to send it back now unfortunately.	0
I wasn't expecting much for the price. I got these for my young daughter, but she was unable to wear them because the studs that go on your ear are way to big and do not fit in a normal persons ear piercing.	0
The set is amazing! it is really classic, beautiful and high quality. The packaging was perfect. Every item is separated from the other by a sponge that saves it. There was a confusion regarding the shipment but I received it finally and BEFORE the estimated delivery date. Their cooperation is highly appreciated. Thanks.	0
Hooked up the TV today. Outstanding picture! I did not expect this quality from a low cost TV. Sound is pretty good. When you set up the TV, go to &#34;Audio&#34; section and manually set the bass level to +8, and the treble to +3. This seems to be the best sound setting for this TV. Overall, I am very pleased with this TV.	1
this is nice to have but I have already had to superglue it together at the center where all the slats connect so I was not real happy about that.	0
This is a great table. Well setting for outside wedding celebrations and these are sturdy and good for parties!	1
These are all over my house. They work for any size room and are completely mess free. Great price for a quality product.	1
This silicone bowl has a low-relief profile of a dog on the bottom.  It easily pops up and stays put until flattened because of the sturdy plastic rim.  The grass green color coordinates with many of my silicone kitchen accessories but there are lots of fun colors to choose from.<br /><br />The bowl is marketed for pets, but works well for human use, too, especially when space is limited, such as when travelling or in a boat or recreational vehicle.  Toddlers can play with it in the bathtub or pool.  The pleated sides and matte silicone make it easy to grip.<br /><br />The bowl holds about 12 oz. to the bottom of rim.  It weighs 58 g ( 2 oz.).  The outside diameter is 5 1/16 in. at the rim, tapering down to a 3 9/16 in. base, and the height is 2 1/8 in. The little tab adds 9/16 in. to the diameter.  When collapsed, it is 9/16 in. tall.<br /><br />Namsan provided a bowl for evaluation and review.	0
There's not much more to say beyond the title for this review. I used it to spiralize a zucchini and had to adjust the vegetable multiple times to ensure it was being cut evenly, but was able to successfully spiralize the vegetable using this tool.	0
I was looking clip on earring. However, it is hard. There is not much of the clip on earring.<br />Anyway, I got cute earring from you guys. It is really cute on my ear. Quality is really good. and yeah, I love it!!<br /> Thank you for selling this item!!!	1
I use this stroller for twin babies. I mostly use it in the city for running errands but have ended up on small gravel pathways the wheels do really well. The stroller is really easy to use; maneuvers well and opens and closes with one pushed button. The storage compartment under the seats can be tricky to access with both car seats in but is still a nice feature as it allows to carry extra. The stroller stores well in a SUV vehicle. Totally happy with this purchase.	0
I bought this product after running out of rustoleum. I sprayed it on aluminum that was sanded and had no paint on it. This stuff sprays in big globs and super thick. It is runny and will drip off whatever you are spraying. The nozzle clogs after every spray so it has to be wiped off every time. I would advoid this product and use rustoleum. That goes on smooth and looks great.	0
These shapewear briefs are more affordable then other brands I considered buying. They offer more support and control. I love the high waist design because it gives me more tummy control and helps define my hips more. They are comfortable to wear and don't leave lines when you put your pants skirts or whatever you are wearing over top	1
Great holster for the price. Fit and finish is good- Not on par with Sparks, Tucker, Alessi, etc., but definitely a great holster at a fraction of the cost. I carry a stainless government model 1911 daily and this holster is comfortable and secure. Would recommend to anyone looking for a good budget-minded EDC.	0
Works quite well, bought 2 and both are good. didn't know I can't listen on 2 headsets on Bluetooth at once (not the suppliers issue, it's the Bluetooth protocol). Wound up listening to travel guides on our trip w/ wired headphones and splitter so my wife and I were on the same page in museums and such. Using this headset for walking and mowing. The earbud on the side w/ the receiver/ switch keeps falling out due to the weight but I have not tried the different ear plugs supplied. Volume switch could be more prominent from the body of the control, hard to find by feel.	1
Excellent quality inside and out, basic but still stainless steel.  Allows 2.5 gallons a minute.  I'm a woman, and installation was easy.  I've installed a few already, and as long as you have plumber's tape, you're good to go. You will not be able to adjust the flow or spray type, but I found it to be more that adequate.	0
My son received this bike from his grandparents for his birthday.  My son turned 3 on July 4th and this was the perfect gift! We also got the matching cars helmet and knee and elbow pads.	0
I've had a few of these coffee and tea infusions, but I can't say that I really liked any of them. This<br /><br />brew in particular is just out of this world terrible for me, but that might just be my taste talking<br /><br />there.	1
We have two Yorkies, age 11 and 6. They both love this food. I usually feed them a half cup a day (divided into two 1/4-cup servings), mixed with about 1/4 cup of water (a thinner oatmeal-like consistency). I like how it's made it real ingredients and is grain-free. I usually buy it at our local pet store where a 4LB box is around $30 or so.	0
I used this with a young man with cerebral palsy. it is a good quality.  He likes it but not as much as the soft blue chewy tubing that he likes that better.  thanks.	0
I recommend this product. It fits well and I like it so much I'm planning on ordering more sets and other colors.	0
Very nice item great price and work as advertized. Will order again if needed for a simular item in the future.	0
The devil is in the details and it is the lack of attention to the details that makes this only an OK bean bag. The fabric is a camo pattern but then the manufacturer puts a large white logo label on the outside of the bag. A handle is provided but the strap is stitched into the top of the bag and with any amount of weight the strap is going to rip out of the fabric. A zipper is provided but it only opens to provide a 3" by 2" opening for pouring in whatever you will be using to fill the bag. The Velcro sections on the bag are a third as long as they should be for the straps to secure the bag.<br /><br />I will keep the bean bag and use it but I would not buy one again nor would I recommend it to others for the reasons mentioned.<br /><br />The bag takes about 1.5 lbs. of buckwheat hulls to get it two-thirds full.	0
I haven't used this myself but I placed the order for two great-great grandmothers and they love this. They say it get rid of all sort of scars including acne(they lend it to their great grandson and he's happy about the product too). That's all that I can say.	0
Very bright light at a good price. This is the best headlight that I have owned. I ride a bike some at night and this light is much brighter than the one I have on the handlebars. You can get headlights specific for biking but they are usually much more expensive.	0
I love this.  We're at the beach 1-2 times a week and this is so great to throw wet and sandy toys in.  It's really wide and holds a lot but the sides aren't very high so toys fall out if tips over or if I bend over.	0
I just received this little stool today.  The color in the picture is very accurate in comparison to the color of the stool (mink brown).  It is a bit smaller than I expected, but that is no problem since it still fits the vanity perfectly.  When I sit on it I'm still able to look directly into my mirror.  The only think I would caution other consumers about is the height of the stool back.  It's only about five inches high from the seat cushion.  So it doesn't offer any back support.  Those are not big issues for me so I gave it 5 stars for the sleekness and design.	0
i have had a number of cd cases and this is by far the best one i have bought. the binders have to be the best feature on this product, that and the 16 slots that are on the inside of the case as well. by the looks of the picture, you would never guess that this thing is HUGE.	1
Tasty but kind of pricey.  I sort of got hooked on these in Germany, and although I can find other Haribo products in stores Color rado can be really hard to find elsewhere.	0
I guess I shouldn't be surprised for the price I paid that this set isn't very durable. The zippers and stitching are the problems. We've used the luggage on two trips and the stitching is coming loose in a few spots. The carry on bag my daughter uses more frequently and the outside zipper popped open. I was able to fix it but it won't last. I'll admit she had the compartment overfilled.<br /><br />I wouldn't say don't buy this because it really is a super cute set and a great price. I'd advise to not overfill the compartments and set your expectations that these won't last long if you travel by airplane and check the luggage.	1
I bought these to have a comfortable pair of slip on shoes for weekends and vacations.  I also bought a pair of slip on Keds because those got pretty decent reviews too.  Hands down, these were the more comfortable and stylish pair of slip on shoes.  I ended up returning the Keds and kept these.  I have worn these shoes with jeans, khakis, dresses and skirts.  I wish I could wear them to work!  These shoes have a very prominent cushion in the sole and it really helps absorb the shock when you're doing a lot of walking.  I really love the color, fit and comfort factor of this shoe.  Thank you for making a great shoe, Reef!	0
They were shipped extremely fast. I seriously got them next day. They have Great sound, but the earphones are  to large for my ears.	1
This really didn't do anything to help my cat's vomiting problem. I saw it works with some reviewers and some didn't. But with me seems like it didn't also. Since they are animals we I don't know how to ask them if did it works?	1
I love this case! My camera fits nicely and there is easy access to the camera. I traveled with it soon after purchase and it was a joy to work with.	1
I love it, i wish i would have purchased the double set. I have had it for just over a month and so far so good!	0
This is such a high quality piece, very solid for the price! It is a MUST to have an electric screwdriver for assembly. I assembled it by myself, but it did take a few hours. I couldn't be happier with how it looks in my dining room. I would highly recommend.	1
These little houses are perfect size to keep in the bath, but rather plain.  NOT MINE.  I spray paint them whatever color I am in the mood for, embellish them with self adhesive rhinestones and they look Great.  Get a plunger with a clear handle, embellish it also and hope you never need to actually USE it.  My latest one is Rustoleum metallic silver and for a Plunger House, it is stunning.	0
To me these are a time-saver from filling them to freezer.<br />I bought mine through Ebay at a good price.<br />I recommend these because they are fast and dependable and i'm very happy with them.<br />Very ingenious idea for putting covers over the water and mine don't leak either.<br />I'm now using these over my ice cube making machine that's how much i enjoy these.	0
Bought this for our chihuahua and it worked immediately after the first couple barks.  We only need to use it every once in a while now.  Our Yorkie was only started barking when we brought home our chihuahua so we used it on him and he also stopped barking immediately.  Since it also has a beep we can also just press the beep button (when they are not wearing it) and they immediately associate the beep with the feeling of the collar so they stop barking.  I only bought this because of the previous reviews.  The cheap price had me hesitant but I'm glad I bought it.  It works and I'm glad we didn't have to spend a lot of money since it took a short time to get them to stop barking.	0
This coin purse is big enough to carry coins keys or paper money, great to carry for those quick errands	0
This is a smart classic looking and feeling bag. Perfect size!The inside is nice looking and has all the compartments you need.	1
This strolling stick was awesome! Simple to fall and an enormous help as I strolled all over Scotland. I was truly glad to have it! No issue in the airplane terminal at all! AS promoted, these strolling sticks agreeably fit into a knapsack or carry-on, are lightweight, collect effectively, and don't slip once their tallness is situated. They held up well on the stone steps and earth ways of the Amalfi Coast and Capri on a late outing. Whether that keeps on being valid over the whole deal stays to be seen, yet I was totally fulfilled by them. It is elusive strolling sticks that overlap this little (14&#34;) at any value or to discover less collapsible sticks at this cost ($50 for two, with material conveying cases included). I'm exceptionally inspired with these. I have been taking a gander at different collapsible poles now for around 18 months, and constantly figured I'd make good and purchase an arrangement of Black Diamonds.	1
This product is a good starter for anyone that wants to have some food stored away for an emergency. The quality is good, but in an emergency I am sure it would taste really good if you are hungry. I like the fact that it has a long storage life and it is easy to store.	1
This is so not cool man. This is not jerky, like at all. My dog wouldn't get near it and he ate vomit one time!	1
This step stool is made well.  It's sturdy.  When my granddaughter uses it to reach the toilet she needs assistance.  It is difficult to turn around on the top step.  Rethinking it now, I would have gotten a little stool to use as a step up to the toilet.	0
These work great. I prefer these over the non float.  Easy to install, and more comfort due to float. A+++	0
Color is like, having a little a bit tight clothes, and activities of shoulders, and a little quality can also	1
For the money, this is a decent value. It looks sharp, and the lining give it a stylish edge. It gets dirty pretty quickly, alas.	0
Good value when purchased this way, and fast Amazon Prime delivery.  Printer cartridges are very pricey, and I'm always happy to find a better way to buy them.	0
Have you ever wished to beat your head against the wall? No? Well just wait until you get half way through this mess, that will be something that seems appealing. EVERYTHING about Die Hard 5 is awful. The acting was phone it in, the dialogue was pathetic and the film was just lousy.	1
I used this with no problem, issues, didn't drop it, etc the day before then went to use it yesterday and it will not turn on. It just literally died. They said they have no warranty. So after only 6 months of very infrequent use, just died. Would not buy again without a warranty from a company that offered one.	1
Apart from its solar feature, the power bank can be charged conventionally from a USB source via its built in Micro-USB socket using the USB lead supplied. Other features include dual USB outputs (one delivers 1A, the other 2.1A 5V), a four LED charge indicator, built-in emergency torch and extensive intelligent protection system against short circuits and over-current etc. The USB cable supplied also doubles to connect the full size USB output ports of the power bank to most smartphones, satnavs and cameras etc. however, I always use the original lead supplied with the device I want to charge. Apple users will need to supply their own charger cable.	1
I bought this based on the &#34;works great for my kayak&#34; reviews.  Well, the lip of their kayak must be totally different from mine, although it seemed that mine is pretty well the same as other recreational kayaks. The mount can only be attached vertically, with the screws going up and down, and there's not enough room on the outer curve of the lip to do that.  Darn, I really though I had something useful.<br /><br />Giving it three stars because it appears to be a quality product, but there should be something in the description that describes the mounting limitations.	0
I placed an order for the camcorder after I used it at my friend's place. I liked the look, the color and above all, the quality and features. Besides producing crystal clear pictures, the storage features and its functionality made it the ideal camcorder	1
At first glance I thought they may be too much in the weight department due to them being rechargeable, boy was I wrong, fit nice over my prescription glasses which is a HUGE plus. Excellent battery life, already bought more.	1
I love this purse!  It seems to be a really nice quality for the price.  I bought the natural tan color because I read on the reviews that the colored purses - like the black one - had a really strong smell.  This one had a strong scent for about 2 days, but I wouldn't describe it as terrible.  And I am pretty sensitive to smells.  I love all of the pocket designs.  And I love the design of the handle how it has a zipper so that you can use it as a backpack or a sling purse.  Nice design.  I am not fond of the lining on the inside, but that is really my only complaint.	0
I have 2 little ones (3 and 2) and the each use these and have really gotten the hang of it. They are dishwasher safe, and the colors don't bleed. I'm also a big fan of the BPA free stuff.	1
These are not as large as I had imagined they would be, but they are a nice quality and are comfortable. They seem to be well-made and are sparkly.	1
I'd like to say I really liked these 'jumbo' dinosaurs. But they are not even jumbo at all. They aren't tiny, but by far jumbo.They are all less than 6 inches in length, and being this smaller size isn't really the big problem. What bugs me about this set, or at least the one that I received, is that there are 4 duplicate dinos. Not just the same dinosaur in a different pose, but I mean 4 exact duplicates. When I pay for 12 dinosaurs, I expect at least 12 dinosaurs in different poses, regardless if there is an occasional same dinosaur, but not 12 dinosaurs with 4 having an exact duplicate twin. The quality is not the worst I have seen before, however in many I can clearly see the mold imprint melted into the dinos. So several look like they have had an operation, and split entirely apart and melted back together. But, what do you expect from anything now days that has 'Made In China' stamped on the bottom. Overall, I'll rate these 3 stars, and lucky they get that. Would not recommend to toddlers, but only kids 5 and up, and expect them to cry when they get 4 exact duplicate dinosaurs.	1
This television has an awesome picture, even when I am laying down to watch tv. Set up was easy, color fantastic and doesn't take a lot of space.	1
My teething daycare baby was relieved of her teething pain. I was a little skeptical until I tried it for myself. It fit my little ones wrist just right. I would do business with this seller again.	1
This is a nice addition for anyone with a Skil circular saw.  This pack offers multiple blades for multiple cut usage.	0
so I normally wear an 8.5 and I ordered a 9. They are a little snug and did not leave me with as much room as I had hoped but more than enough room if wearing a pair of thin socks. Other than that BEST BUY EVER!!! these boots are so cute.	0
Nice product for a good price. I purchased two at the same time. Love the perfect fit on my Galaxy S6 and the phone power and volume buttons are completely covered.	1
Had never heard of using a filter when diving, but used this one on my recent cruise and couldn t believe the difference. I had no idea it could be so easy to make my video more colorful. Almost lost it on my first dive, but realized they do include a tether to attach to the camera so you don t lose it. Silly me. The micro fiber bag is pretty nice too for keeping it clean.	1
This is a great product! Not only do the adhesives stick to the ceiling, but the stars shine brightly. The kids love them!	0
We went on an international trip that spanned Europe, Asia and South America. This worked wherever we went, granted with a few modifications and with the help of adaptors. Nevertheless, an effective product is an effective product and deserves to be called as such.	1
I must admit it is well built and durable. I literally sweat a half liter in the first use at night, after walking for about an hour. Sizing is a bit on the small size so u would recommend buying a size larger than u normally wear. But I will recommend this to anyone looking for a sweat.	1
The addition of inside pockets would have made this a 5-star rating.  Otherwise, my son loves it and uses it at school.	0
Just like most of the others stated the inside bolt towards the lean is a problem to install.  Had to drill out with a larger bit from the bottom as another buyer suggested and then it was fine.  Like the look and will protect winch when I get one.	0
Easy to assemble and was delivered with exceptional service. I am very pleased, however, one of the cushions had staple marks in the back from the packaging. I am sure if i had known that i could have called customer service, that i might have been able to fix it by replacing the cushion, but i did not know at the time.	1
Did not come with the features described, exact size as the regular band sold in stores... Not expanded!	0
This is an OK Punch set for the price but will bend if you hit them too hard with a rubber mallet. I use them to field strip and break down my guns.	0
My daughter is a huge one directoin fan. When I saw this necklace I knew it would be the perfect gift for her birthday. She wears it every day to school. great buy!	1
great bottles. i know its a lot of parts but worth it. you don't have to worry about burping your baby as much because he or she isn't swallowing as much air	0
I've had one of these Camera Connection Kits for many years, but recently lost one of the adapters. The connectors allow me to transfer photos from a digital camera to my iPad. I think the kit is a bit pricey for what you get (but so is most everything from Apple), but friends have had issues with cheaper knock-offs - and I never have had a problem.	0
These were a nice addition to our living room the wood has a nice finish that matches the room perfect. The family loves them and we are definitely getting our money's worth	1
Super sharp, this cut my finger once becasue I was holding it wrong. Great item, not cheap at all, has a nice weight to it unlike the other plastic ones.	1
I think it just could no longer efficiently handle all the wireless devices nowadays. I did not hesitate one bit to get another refurb from Netgear and neither should you!	1
I got this bag about a year ago. It's held up well, Nice and large for lots of stuff and still looks new.  I am very pleased.	0
Same as the quality section above. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I considered returning it to them, but since I had it assembled, it was too much to take apart and put in the box as received.	1
If you are going to use it for playing Counter Strike Global Offensive, like me, you can just go ahead and buy this right now!	1
I returned this item which was cheaply made; the latch that holds the batteries was ill-fitting so the tester did not function. Probably wouldn't work in the event of a real CO emergency either.	1
I got this one to my husband instead of getting another thick curtains. Now he can sleep in until the late morning.	0
Very cute and so affordable!  This dress has a flattering cut. For the price, I couldn't ask for more.  Will buy more dresses from Anna Kaci.	0
I own the 18&#34; china and thought this would make a great addition to my kit. It provides the perfect sound I was looking for. Crisp, short, dry and high frequency. looks and sounds beautiful	0
Never buy another box spring again. My box spring wouldn't fit up a curvy staircase so I got this. It's light and super easy to assemble. Also there is so much more room under my bed for storage. I feel like the support of the mattress is great as well!  I regret not coming across this product any sooner!	0
Sea Power of the State, written by Admiral of the Fleet Sergei G. Gorshkov and published in 1976 during his tenure as the Soviet Navy's Commander-in-Chief, provides a rarely available view into the strategic thinking which guided the development and disposition of Russian Naval forces during the 1960's and 1970's; the first time Russia possessed naval forces capable of conducting sustained operations on the world's oceans--albeit a fleet relying primarily on submarines. A considerable achievement given that when Gorshkov assumed command of the Russian Navy in 1956 it consisted primarily of vessels designed for coastal defense and was incapable of logistically supporting the ocean operation of its few capital ships or its large submarine force.  A former Naval Officer who was assigned during the aforementioned period to ships participating in an ASW (Anti-Submarine Warfare) Group which on occasion practiced the art of ASW by chasing Soviet submarines across the Pacific Ocean, as well as having personally participated as an Officer of the Deck (OOD) in sea going Soviet Navy precipitated surface confrontations, I found Gorshkov's writings interesting and most informative. "Sea Power of the State," however, is not an easy read, perhaps due to translation difficulties when proceeding from Russian into English or due to the style in which Gorshkov communicated his thoughts. Further, individual points are to frequently repeated, almost to the point of nuisance. And, of course, the book is replete with "socialist" anti-western verbiage about the evil motivations of the aggressive imperialist nations--especially the United States. Given the Soviet Union's de facto record of Eastern Europe colonization, a reader can only wonder whether Gorskov's expressed political views actually reflect the thinking of the Soviet High Command or were just pro forma boilerplate.  "Sea Power of the State" is divided into several parts and opens with a 25+ page dissertation on the economic significance of ocean floor minerals, etc. giving the impression this geological survey will play a key factor underlying Gorshkov's strategic views, however, the subject area essentially (not totally) disappears from the book thereafter. It is followed by a similarly treated 30 page discussion of the importance of fishing and merchant shipping to the sea power of a state.  The next two chapters contain a 100+ page view of "The History of [Selected] Navies" and a 50+ page treatise on the author's views of the "The Development of Navies after the Second World War." These reviews and their encompassed assessments seem to provide the historical analysis on which Gorshkov based the strategic goals and objecitves he envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing and the force formations he would configure to affect those goals.  When reviewing the American and British oceanic conflict with opposing German and Japanese fleets, Gorshkov's concentration repeatedly focuses how (he viewed) submarine warfare's influence on the war's outcome, leading him to conclude:  "Submarines become the most important means of battle at sea. And if individual states in the pre-war period underestimated their possibilities, in the course of the war they changed their views on the use of submarine forces. .... Earlier the view was repeatedly expressed that submarines are a weapon of the weakest fleet and that strong fleets have no need of them. However, this view was flatly rebutted by the experience of the war [when] submarines of the strongest American fleet performed [the] most important role ... not only ... against Japanese shipping, but also against surface ships and submarines."  Gorshkov, however, fails to correctly comprehend the strategically decisive role played by Aircraft Carriers and their Air Groups during World War II in the Pacific. He absurdly attributes the Japanese post-Battle of Midway retreat onto the defensive as having occurred due to the Soviet Army's victory at Stalingrad. To Gorshkov the Aircraft Carrier centric surface battles of the Pacific War could have no strategic effect because the force levels involved were so much less then were engaged in the manpower intensive (slaughters) on the Soviet / German Eastern front, perhaps demonstrating a flaw in the strategic thinking of Russian Admirals resulting from their nation's geographically necessitated concentration on large scale ground warfare. Other historical events such as the participation of Russian sailors in their country's 20th Century Civil War and the Soviet Navy's (exaggerated) contributions to the outcome of World War II are discussed in these page, but this commentary adds little to the understanding of the strategic goals Gorshkov envisioned the Soviet Navy pursuing in the post-World War II environment.  Building on this historical analysis Gorshkov concludes that "problems associated with the art of naval warfare" render dominance of the sea an unobtainable strategic result--as versus its possible achievement on land surfaces. His analysis underlying this conclusion is to lengthy to repeat here, but it rests on several observations and assumptions. First, Gorshkov believes that the fluid non-fixed nature of the sea precludes a naval force from firmly establishing itself in a fixed location enforcing that dominance and, second, that modern weapons systems enable fleets to extend the distance over which they could apply their [explosive] force thereby contesting any attempt at fixed dominance of a given sea area.   Clearly Russian strategic thinking did not encompass the need to establish forward bases such as those the U.S. Navy maintains around the world, probably due to the Russian military's demonstrated inability to manage substantial logistics flow over a long distance, precluding their establishing and maintaining distant bases. I personally know a number of intelligent former Russian soldiers who served in Afghanistan and asked them why the combat force the Soviet Army sent into that country was so numerically low. Their response was that their military simply lacked the logistic capabilities to sustain a force greater than 120,000 men that far from home. An acknowledgement that their nation simply lacked the management skills to logistically support a large force such as a Naval Task Group far from home, which Gorshkov must have realized.  However, despite their logistics management shortcomings, the Soviet Union did possess sufficient bright individuals with technical engineering skills and the industrial structure needed to design, produce, and staff a large number of nuclear powered submarines carrying modern weapons systems, communications capabilities, etc. needed for their Navy to maintain a large number of these vessels at sea. A technical and industrial base which Admiral Gorshkov notes necessarily underlies the development of modern navies and without which a nation cannot successfully aspire to be a sea power. Gorshkov's answer, therefore, to his problems was the deployment of a large number of nuclear powered submarines which could steam almost indefinitely at sea, restricted only by their crews need for food. A force that could target the sea communications the "imperialist" western industrial nations needed to support their worldwide "aggressive" interventions, at least in the socialist speak of the Soviet high command.  "Sea Power of the State" is a fascinating look into the mind of the high command of one of this nation's major military opponents. It is a rare treat and makes for a fascinating read, at least for officers of the opposing services and for anyone interested in how high level military officers view problems--especially a military officer as prominent and influential as was Admiral Gorshkov.	0
I plan to leave a video review tomorrow so that you can see the dress on, how it fits, so how it flows, etc.  For now, however, I will say this...It's amazing, completely worth the money!  This is one of my favorite things I have ever ordered off of amazon.<br /><br />I ordered this to be a piece of my LARPing wardrobe, and was not sure how it would turn out, since it wasn't sold as a "costume" per se.  The fact that it doesn't feel like a costume is what sets it apart from pretty much everything else I have ever bought.  It feels like real clothes probably would have felt back in medieval times, sturdy, solid.  More so than even the real clothes I buy at kohls now!  I love the material, it is not hot or scratchy, it is smooth and cool, but still heavy.  I love the way it fits and the way it hangs and the way it moves with me. The only complaint I have is that i wish the tie was positioned a little higher to hang and tighten right under the breasts.  It is about an inch lower than it feels like it should be, and I have DD's! But I can tie the string really tight while it is pulled up where I want it and I can get it to stay there for a good long while.  I could be a touch smaller, yes, and if there was an option to buy a Small, instead of a S/M/L, I would go with that, but on the other hand it is nice that if I wanted to let someone borrow it as a costume, it could fit a variety of sizes, and would be perfect for that.<br /><br />Personally I am about 5'2", 120 lbs, 26" waist, and it is loose on me, but the drawstring really makes all of the difference.  Also, as I am short, I have to hold up the skirts when I walk, but I don't mind because it kind of fits the style of the time period I am going for.<br /><br />Also, if you are considering purchasing this for COSplay, like me, this works great as an under-dress for corsets or bodices!<br /><br />I hope that helps!  Seriously, this is one of the best COSplay pieces I have ever come across!  It is an excellent buy!  If only Lotus Traders had this dress in other colors in a size small, I would be buying it in red, black, and white, as well...although the green is a great "woodsy" green!  Love it!	0
My grandson tells me it's excellent. It made him very happy, which made me happy. Price was competitive.	0

I was expecting this to be a fruity tea like the Strawberry one which is delicious.  It is more like a black tea with a smoky, almost vanilla like flavor and a little acidity.  It is an OK tea but not the flavor I was looking for.	0

The little red engine is James, a friend of the blue train Thomas. It's wooden, with good detail. Glad I picked this up on sale though for $7. Although slightly larger than the wooden Thomas train, because of the coal car, it's still small.	1
Using this product in conjunction with other topicals for my P.<br />I do not believe in Homeopathic, you have to have Faith, which ain't my thing.<br />However-- the cream has a use as a pleasant base ; no side effects that i can tell.<br />Price is reasonable.<br />Don't buy this expecting anything else.	0
I purchased this rug for the hall in my new house. We have moved in March. All I know for now is that the rug is the color I purchased and it feels very soft! I highly recommend this rug.	1
&#34;be warned before you read this that these books ARE NOT for everyone. I liked them and thought that it was well written from the main characters point of view, (though with some parts its kinda hard to believe though but its fiction, people!) some parts were not my cup of tea but i read em anyways.. i have read more graphic books than this..<br />while i am not going to tell you anything about the story itself(go to any of the ebook sellers and read a sample, if it hooks you in then you just might like it) I found myself hooked into the story and I recommend it.... the choice in the end is up to you!!! I give it 5 stars!! &#34;	1
Yesterday I had this for breakfast for the first time. I knew that my mother cannot made this food and she don't have the time even if she knew the method. So I asked her about the food. Then she showed me this packet. I was really thrilled by knowing that this food is made of the best natural energy supplement, hemp seeds. The taste is so amazing too.	1
I highly recommend these glasses, they are comfortable, stylish and work just fine, but if you are a lady who sometimes puts her glasses on top of her head as a hairband, you should look more closely at the sizing than i did to make sure you get something that will stay put.	1
I really like this bikini and you can't beat the price. You actually get what you see in the picture.	1
My first choice when it comes to cocoa powder comes from a very exclusive source and is really hard to get. When I'm running tight, this is an excellent substitute that comes close to the same richness.	1
I have always used this particular type of feeder for my Hummers. My only complaint is that the bases do not last as long as the bottle and Perky Pet charges almost as much (if you include the shipping charge) as it costs for a whole new feeder. Therefore I am forced to either throw away perfectly good feeder bottles that could still be used or spend as much on the replacement base as I would on a new feeder. I have three bases right now sitting unused under my kitchen sink that could be outside but for the fact that I can not being myself to pay for the replacement base.	1
I have horse saddles that always need a good rub down with leather cleaner. I also have some things around the house that could benefit from some leather conditioner. So when I was offered this Leather Care Liniment from Chamberlain's for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered immediately. It arrived and I started the leather line-up. Started with the saddles, then some boots, even my leather jacket got some love. If you have leather objects that you know need some conditioning and cleaning, I recommend trying this Leather Milk from Chamberlain's.	0

Don't waste your money on this product. It's made of cheap parts that are unstable and don't work. The attachments wobble and come apart. Customer service is the worst ever. Even if you end up with a defective product, they won't refund the shipping costs. Search other reviews and you'll see it's a waste of money.	1
I'm giving it 4 stars cause the image looks different than the online picture, it is engraved and its only one sided. And I recommend getting it from Stealth Rabbit who delivers it quickly and free and have other large selection of zippo lighters.	0
The idea of the vacuum is very good. It's nice to be able to have the extra suction power when needed to vacuum hairs from carpets.  The execution however was not so impressive. It would be more convenient to have a vacuum that picks up what is needed automatically, rather than having to push another button.  The materials used feel cheap and the cables fall when pushing the vacuum.  When I initially pushed the button, the roller didn't work and my husband had to adjust it to get it to work. The automatic rewind worked well initially, but then required that I hold the cable to help feed it.  Overall, a good idea, but needs some improvements in material quality and engineering to be a great vacuum.	0
This seemed like a strange little kitchen gadget, but as one that appreciates and enjoys strange little kitchen gadgets, I was intrigued.<br /><br />If you're a minimalist in the kitchen, this mincer is really not for you. It's a specialty item, for sure, and if your kitchen is cramped and small, without a lot of room for different gadgets, this probably isn't for you. That being said, it has a small profile and is easily tucked away.<br /><br />I was impressed with how sturdy this item was. Putting it together was pretty intuitive, though I did check the directions once or twice. We have solid surface granite countertops, and I was pleased with how well the suction adhered. This little gadget wasn't going anywhere while I was mincing.<br /><br />Unlike the picture, you can't stick an entire carrot in the mincer and expect it to mince. (That's the only reason I knocked off a star - I feel like the picture is misleading). This thing is dependent on your strength to mince--it's not a powered item--so you have to work pretty hard to get it to mince even large pieces of carrot. It works best when you cut items into smaller pieces. And despite the fact that it's advertised as a carrot mincer, you can mince other items in here as well. I'd stick to veggies, generally.	0
I was looking for sme high quality HDMI cables so  I bought this 2-pack. I am very satisfed! Very resitive, high quality material, length is enough as i need. This nice cables works really great and fast. I really recommend it! I will also buy this cables to my friend!	1
Misses the mark. The book was authored in the stiff upper lip British style which tends to be understated. Had to often skip several pages or just barely scan them for anything worthwhile. From an American movie viewer's taste, the narrative doesn't truly come alive until Mason moves to Hollywood.<br /><br />Very little is told that is interesting. In fact, the author harps repeatedly about that Mason is insular and not interested in showing any emotion other than when he puts down a few co-stars. Difficult to empathize with him.<br /><br />The author does little to give insight into behind-the-scenes of Mason's movies. Mostly one or two sentence mentions that he did this or that. As if he read Wikipedia.  Am guessing that one will get a story if he can find the one written by Mason himself..	0
Bigelow teas, to me, all taste watered down and bitter. No flavor and nasty to the pallette. Waste of money on this purchase. Yuck.	0
This kit was easy to attach to my Medela Symphony 2, which made it easy to get started. I appreciated this, since I ended up pumping earlier than I'd intended to, due to the infant needing supplementation in the early days.  I'd started out with a pump provided by insurance. Once I ordered this system and started pumping, my output (on the same day I'd used the hospital pump)  doubled.  Definitely worth the investment if you need to maximize milk production.	0
Unfortunately this device get disconnected frequently and after a while it gets frustrating to turn it on and off constantly so I returned it. I have a Lenovo laptop with Windows 8 as OS	0
I received the product. Are happy to try the product. Thank you.<br />If the opportunity we will buy again.	1
I bought this wallet for the design with the stars.<br /><br />I didnt expect the leather to be so smooth and beautiful.<br /><br />I bookmarked this brand.	1
What's with people saying the book was bad because the main character was selfish and stupid in her decisions? Do you honestly think this book would be compelling to read if the main character was the perfect character, Mother Teresa, expert backpacker? Name one piece of good literature where the main character is perfect. Would you prefer if Cheryl lied and talked about how perfect she was and how smooth the journey was? Some of the reviews of this book I've read on goodreads are a perfect example of how annoyingly judgmental human beings are.	1
I am a researcher.  I read every review - the good and the bad.  I've read the Consumer Reports reviews, read the Amazon reviews, read the other, sketchier review websites like GreatGarbageDisposals.com (I made that one up but if you've done any research on the internet you get my point).  I am writing this review to share what I learned about the product and about the many reviews I've read.  My situation was that our 6 year old Badger froze up and simply quit on me, so a new one was in order.<br /><br />First, is it loud or quiet?  It really depends on which review you read, apparently.  I believe it depends on more than that, such as what kind of sink is it being installed under - a stainless steel or a porcelain coated cast iron sink?  One is very thin and flexible and will not block out as much noise or damp vibrations as effectively as a heavy cast iron sink.  I have found the overall noise level to be a lot like the Badger 5 that I replaced.  My wife thinks it sounds a bit different but neither louder nor quieter. It also depends on whether this is your first disposer (it is certainly louder than not having one) or a replacement.  Bottom line, it's typically run for a few seconds, with the water running too, as you are cleaning up after meal (not in the middle of the night when everyone's trying to sleep) and it's no louder or quieter than the rest. I wouldn't let that be a deciding factor unless you have different criteria.  If so, you can pay twice as much for that other &#34;Elite&#34; one by another manufacturer that is CR-rated as the quietest one.  In my case I couldn't justify the added cost.<br /><br />What's up with that scary loud noise when you turn it on?  There are some reviews that make this sound like it is eating a spoon (a LOUD, disturbing, and/or startling snap or click noise, etc.).  I have to say that was one of my biggest reservations when I ordered this thing, having read the reviews.  A fairly large slice of reviewers commented negatively on it.  Here's my take...  The motor is 3/4 HP compared to my little dinky 1/3 HP motor on my old one.  That is a lot more horsepower and, consequently, a lot more torque.  The little &#34;teeth&#34; that do the waste grinding that sit in the base of the chamber spin freely.  When you turn it on, the little grinders snap into place like how your head gets whipped back on one of those crazy spinning carnival rides. It's just from centrifugal force setting the blades into place.  The fine print in the directions tell you that it is part of the anti-jam mechanism.  It's not startling or even disconcerting to me or my wife.  We didn't blink an eye. I couldn't scare my children by turning it on.  It just makes a bit of a click when you turn it on. No biggie.  Full disclosure here - ours is mounted to the bottom of a heavy, porcelain coated cast iron sink.  Our sink may be better at handling the torque and may dampen the sound and vibration more than a thin stainless steel sink.  Our sink weighs probably 75 pounds.  A stainless steel sink weighs 7 pounds.  A heavier sink can probably handle a garbage disposal operating under full load better than a flexible, lightweight sink.  That's not why we got the sink but I think it's probably a benefit to damping sounds and vibrations.<br /><br />Some folks knocked the instructions.  Take heart.  It appears that the Waste King guys have heard the criticisms from the negative reviewers.  I am guessing that they have been re-written to better explain the installation because they are really easy to follow.  My best advice is this: don't be afraid of a difficult or confounding set of installation instructions.  It is really easy.  Here's what you do. Go to youtube.com and search for a video on How To Remove Your Existing Garbage Disposal because this is the hardest part.  You will find one that matches yours.  Watch it.  I started removing the Badger incorrectly, stopped, watched a video, and then it was a piece of cake.  In my case, I shouldn't have removed the three long screws before removing the body of the old one. You do it after it is disconnected.  READ the instruction manual carefully.  Then go ahead and youtube the Waste King installation video.  It is very easy once you see it done.  No filing or grinding gaskets, and Good Lord, no car jacks under your sink please.  If it is hard then you are doing something wrong. STOP!!! Review the procedure. Start again. The directions are actually very explicit.  The parts are well labeled. The diagrams show you what to do. The videos show you what to do.  If you prepare yourself (15 minutes of reading and watching videos, tops) you will fly though the installation and be a happy person.<br /><br />Regarding the comments that the EZ Mount is flimsy or cheap or plastic, I have to respectfully disagree.  The purpose of the lock ring is to compress the rubber gasket tight enough to make a seal so the thing doesn't leak.  It doesn't need to be made from titanium or cast iron.  Just because it isn't made from a rare earth metal doesn't make it inferior!  It keeps the price down and works (so far) flawlessly.  I did not need to tap the ears with a small hammer to get it to slide to the fully locked position - I was able to twist it into place with my bare non-Superman hands.  I did not need to put dish soap on the ear slots but the directions suggest doing that if it is difficult to put into locked position.<br /><br />Removing ALL the old mounting hardware, cleaning everything really good, and installing the EZ Mount was truly a very easy and thoroughly explained process.  No leaks at all on my first attempt!<br /><br />As advertised, it does come with a corded plug so it will need an outlet.  My old Badger was a direct wire.  Some folks tore out the cord and the strain relief as a fix and hard wired it like their old one.  Some folks put an outlet in, which I found that to be a 15 minute job.  I didn't want to mess around with chopping out the stock cord and putting in a new one and messing with the strain relief replacement.  I thought the new outlet process was much easier because, heck, the wire's already there and that's always the hardest part of wiring a box!  I shoved some of the extra length of the existing wire back into the hole in the wall that it came out from. I thought carefully about where the new box should go so the body of the disposal didn't hit it.  I screwed it to the back of the cabinet, poked the wires into the box, screwed them to a new receptacle and, voila!. NOTE: IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING WITH ELECTRICAL WIRING, DO NOT ATTEMPT THIS YOURSELF.  If you do, be sure to kill the power at the circuit breaker and it is probably the easiest box you will install.  Just make sure it is securely mounted into something besides the flimsy back panel of the cabinet.<br /><br />I think those are all the important items I wanted to share.  The removal of the old one, cleaning the sink hole, and putting in the new box took about 35 minutes start to finish.  I wasn't rushing but I was well prepared and had everything ready to go.  Plumbers Putty was needed for install.  Make sure you have that on hand.  There was a thin rubber gasket that went under the flange (between the top flange and a stainless steel sink) that I didn't use because I didn't have a stainless steel sink.  The one tricky thing I recall from the directions is that the same procedure is repeated twice in a couple of places - one for using the existing Badger mounting hardware and one for if you are using the EZ Mount system.  If you are using the EZ Mount, make sure to SKIP the paragraph that is describing the work as it applies to the Badger mount.  That's about it.  I had to cut 3/4&#34; off the black waste discharge pipe (90 degree elbow piece that screws into the new disposal) so that everything fit with my old plumbing.  I loosened up all the slip joints on the old plumbing so I could wiggle things around as needed, aligned everything, and tightened the plumbing back up.  New install was completed in well under 20 minutes after the removal and outlet installation.<br /><br />I hope this helps some folks who were undecided about this product.  How can you ignore a 10 year warranty on something that is well below the price of competing models?  No regrets here - we've had it almost a month now and use it daily.  We can FINALLY grind those lemon and lime wedges!!!<br /><br />One last thought - Beef bones?  I see that Consumer Reports tests these things by measuring the fineness of the grind using beef bones.  Do people really put beef bones down a garbage disposal on purpose?  You might think I'm babying mine, or maybe that's why I didn't have excessive vibration when I use it, but I'll put the beef bones in the trash and grind up the rest of the stuff with this and be just fine for many years to come, I hope!	0
I LOVE this hairspray! It truly holds but is soft and flexible. The scent us very very light which is nice because who wants to smell like hairspray or cheap perfume? Unfortunately, Dove discontinued this and replaced it with the new one in the pink can which is AWFUL. The new spray smells awful, is sticky, weighs down my hair, and makes my hair somewhat stiff. What was Dove thinking?????  Please Dove bring back the old formulae in the blue can!!!	0
Thanks so much, Just the right size and beautiful colors! Can't wait to were it on my honeymoon to the beach!	0
Both parts of the case have rubbery finish that picks up dirt very quickly and ends up looking filthy. I also have a problem with power button which is very hard to press.	1
I bought this for my pet dog which had very bad tick and flea attack with my vet advice. This product has helped my dog getting cured from the ticks and fleas. I would highly recommend this!!	1
Love this bag. I can store five fluffy pillows in here and throw in a comforter too. Takes up a lot of room, but easier to use than a vacuum bag. Comes with a zipper and handle, and seems sturdy.	0
It is the perfect size for a day trip. It's REALLY fit for daily life when u need to carry books,clothing or others that's not that large or heavy objects.The backpack is  perfect for a day hike for snacks,some clothing and books for me. Also extra shirt and other essential things. Would be very great for a festival or arts fest. Not bulky. Very very comfortable.	1
I read this book 2 1/2 years ago, loved it then, still love it now!  I don't remember how much detail the author gave on nootropics but it was after reading this book I began my quest to sharpen my mind and improve my overall cognitive functioning.  This book is inspiring as it is factual, in my opinion.<br /><br />Besides following the exercises clearly outlined in this book, I also began researching and eventually taking a combination of nutritional supplements called nootropics (i.e. piractem, aniracetam, etc).  They were first discovered 30+ years ago and were used to treat serious medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and ADHD.  Then after scientists began recommending them as cognitive enhancers to the public, they started to become a very popular brain supplement.<br /><br />They are a very intriguing family of supplements.  My suggestion to anyone looking to improve their brain function is to look into some type of natural brain supplement, everyone is different so do your own research like I did and decide for yourself if it's a good idea.  Besides experimenting with a few nootropics, I've been taking ginseng and ginko for years, [[ASIN:B009K30D28 Ginseng Complex Plus Royal Jelly (1000 Mg) + FREE Ginkgo Biloba Extract (30 Mg) 60 Tablets]].  They're inexpensive and effective, plain and simple.<br /><br />And of course if you haven't already, read this book which, for me, was my personal inspiration and the beginning of my journey to a better me; [[ASIN:1594480931 The Better Brain Book]].	1

These ink cartridges have saved the day. I was really paying a lot each month to print, and so much I was thinking about running to the nearest office max just to pay them to do it. However, I don't have to now. These cartridges really last a long time and print brilliant color. I am so happy I found this brand.	1
We ordered this for a road trip for our daughter.  She test ran it two days in a row before the trip and it worked great.  Nice picture, quiet, worked great with headphones, we even bought the car adapter.  Trip day we get it from her room, placed flat on a surface with no visible damage of any kind, push play and the lens that reads the disks is stuck in a mode where the gear spins constantly.  The lens will not move or read any disk and attempts to free the assembly from being jammed did not work.  Basically, we wasted the money and got nothing so we are trying a return.	0
I have triplet sisters, so I bought 4 of these rings as sister rings...and the pictures on here made them look so elegant. Then when I got all the rings, I was so disappointed. I am embarrassed to give the rings to my sisters.	1
why is the hot tub always broken?!? Just don't miss the chili dinner at the club and you can make your own bubbles, hahaaha	1
The formula was just what I was looking for - needed a higher sodium/potassium ratio and wanted some phosphorus in there.  Mixes well, taste is okay, and the price is good.  Will keeping buying it.	0
Adeline Yen Mah tells an interesting story of culture, abuse, and commitment. This was a new look for me at Chinese heritage. As a daughter from a wealthy Chinese family, she gives insight into the abuse that knows no economic boundary. She had a cruel Eurasian mother that added a whole new element to the traditional family. Adeline eventually moves from China to England and then to the US while trying to preserve her family ties back home. It was an interesting look at three cultures and how they affect our image of family. It was an interesting read but be prepared for a terribly abusive story.	1
Thanks Amazon for providing this battery!  It lasts so long unplugged! And the cost was only a fraction of the original battery from Dell.	0
This is the perfect book for the time. Despite the fact that our economy has slowly been improving in recent years Americans are still searching for that "Six-Figure Career" and this book hits the nail on the head. The author has taken the bull by the horn and has enlightened me on what works and what we might have thought were great ideas but are actually crap. As he touched the topic of self branding and marketing I was totally shocked at the stupid things I thought were great strategies. This is definitely a great piece of work, great read	1
Darksyde Pitch Black ultimate silicone bronzer tanning lotion made me realize that there is still hope for those who have pretty dull skin tone.	1
This Flat jaw lathe tuning chuck is awesome to use when tuning bowls. This chuck hols great on all types of wood.	0
This new umbrella provides shade for a very large area. I'm having a bit of a problem finding concrete slabs to fit under the edge, so I used 4 square concrete stepping stones to hold it down. The umbrella itself moves too much during a strong breeze but other than that it's really nice.	1
The only thing that I noticed about this pick is that the edges are not rounded like the other (usual) picks. The pick is cut with the edges on the right angle pace and I love it so much. It adds on the crisp of the sound coming from  the guitar. It made my guitar-playing-time better and more delicious (?) I highly recommend this to everyone.	1
Fake reviews. this product taste like crap and is so expensive. But I give it 2 stars because you said its healthy LOL	1
This bag is modern looking with many pockets and pouches to store everything my little one will need. It comes with a bag for dirty/wet laundry and a changing pad. The only thing I wasn't 100% happy about was that the colour I wanted wasn't available. Everything else is fabulous!	1
This is a really nice piece. I purchased it for my Husband whose parents came from Haiti. We have recently merged households and as is typical most of the woman's stuff takes precedence.... This piece has done a great job of bringing his heritage to our home...fits in nicely to our eclectic style and pairs up with some other Haitian art. I do wonder about it authenticity?	1
Loved my rugs! They are so pretty and sparkle just ever so slightly.....They are lovely over other rugs as well that are larger.....I did that with some of mine and love them.....I have the dark brown they are gorgeous!	1
Awesome game to play. Magnificent graphics and sounds! The sounds of the blazing guns will make you wanna make you pull the trigger every second. There are also a lot of changes from the original game which makes it more enjoyable.<br /><br />Give this game a whirl and you will not be disappointed. I assure you of that.	1
I bought this as an extra since for my travel and school. It worked great, moving it from home to school. The power adapter works as advertised I didn't have any complaints about it, it does the job as my original adapter for an affordable price.	1
The product is not bad, but I could never get used to it neither did my baby. He felt a bit uncomfortable in carrier, so I never used it much.	0
Este libro aporta gran conocimiento bíblico, social e histórico que ayuda a desarrollar un estudio más profundo y a tener una mejor comprensión de estas dos epístolas, ¡Valiosisimo libro para impartir estudios bíblicos!	0
This 6 pint compartment condiment holder truly simplifies family get together's and other functions.  It also cuts down on the amount of space needed for all the different things such relishes, condiments, onions and other necessities to a good cook out.  I love that this condiment tray has a built in cover that is easily slid back down.  There is also a compartment in the bottom of this that will allow you to put ice.  Clean up is very easy with this due to each compartment being removable.	1
love anything to do with Jacqueline Bissett great actress got to order THE DEEP with her and Nick Nolte  great movie…….great for the thanksgiving time….	0
Calphalon LX Series knives feature traditional German style blades with thick spines, hefty weight, forged full tang construction.  This chef's knife has a highly curved cutting edge that facilitates mincing by rocking the blade between the heel and point.  Recommendation:  Before buying, remove the knife from the box and see if its weight and balance match your preferences.  The blade is labeled &#34;GERMAN STEEL MADE IN CHINA.&#34;  Calphalon customer support advised that both the steel and the knife were made in China, but declined to identify the alloy. In my sample, the blade was sharp out of the box. The edge quality is easily maintained with a few strokes on a sharpening steel. The alloy is not a super-hard exotic steel, but holds its edge well enough in practical use. Hand wash and dry promptly after using.  Manufacturer offers lifetime warranty after user registration.  The LX Series knives have been discontinued.  They have been offered at substantial savings in off-price stores.	0
I bought Wedding Dance Mastery System 5 DVD Set from amazon. It's really awesome entertainment DVD set.  when I watching this, great fun with my partner and start to dance at this moment in my friend wedding.  This  instructions  described in detail, how a novice can turn to a professional, dancing Waltz, Foxtrot, Swing and Rumba. Really it's impress me.	1
It is one thing to be a fan, but life is better when others know who you represent. This Ohio State koozie not only allows me to hold my beer can steadily, but express my team spirit in this year's national champions. Do not have to worry about them getting saturated with the can's sweat and it seeping through the koozie wall either.	1
This collar started misfunctioning within days of first use.  It was going off whether my dog was barking at all.  Poor baby.  It was not worth returning price wise.  Don't bother trying to safe money.  Get a real collar that won't confuse and annoy your dear pet.	0
I found Hiline while looking for a good price and alternatives to Nespesso. I gave it a shot and I'm glad I did! Coffee from Hiline has nice aroma and most importantly the lively, fresh and bold taste. Actually, a couple of weeks ago I've been sent a new blend - Greenwich Village, which is new and I did not had a chance to find it on Amazon (packaging with macaroons in a brown bag) OMG! It's beautiful! They definitely know how to make good coffee. I'll be waiting for the official launch!	1
My vet recommended this for our cats with allergies. At one time, they were herpes suspect, but that's since been ruled out and we've discovered they have a nasty grain allergy. Lysine helps with general health -- and we dose once a week just to keep them going.<br /><br />The great thing about this product is the taste. All four of our cats like these treats and will readily eat them. Actually the problem is, they will also readily eat the lysine of the other cats if they finish first!<br /><br />Rebecca Kyle, March 2014	0
I like how this easily sticks to our car's windows and does a good amount of cover when the sun is too bright and hot.	1
This one keeps you warm during triathlons, and surfing the ocean. the best.  we got two of them and they also fit perfectly though they run a bit smaller.  guess tight is better for water.	0
I will probably never buy any other brand ever again! According to other customers, the size of this item is a bit smaller than usual. It is somewhat small but it really fits to me.	1
We bought this kit knowing full well it may not last long...it didn't. We maybe got one load dried in our dryer before it broke again. In the end had to get a new dryer.	0
[[VIDEOID:moLZ4QJ7O98VCA]]This video will show you the problem of this device and a way you MIGHT be able to reduce the risk, if you already own one, of the two joining plastic molds that "snapped" apart (something INSIDE the mold kept the two parts JOINED) causing your camera to wiggle therefore causing "shaky" photos and/or videos.<br />1. Great concept.<br />2. Poorly manufactured.<br /><br />Over time (about 50 hours of use), the black handle came off the chrome/metal. I ALMOST lost my ContourHD camera in the ocean! As I lengthen the pole, the black handle separated from the chrome pipe. I could not put the handle back securely. The other major issue was the two plastic molds where the tripod screwed came out of - SEE VIDEO. This is a MAJOR problem and do not recommend this pole/stick because the molds joining is poorly manufactured and unable to sustain normal stress causing the joined structure to separate and your camera to wiggle at the end of the pole. I weight my ContourHD camera = 5 ounces.<br /><br />I REALLY LOVE this device and wished IT WAS MORE DURABLE!	0
Nice one. Very useful. And the fact that I put my keys here, I can also put some of my little tools here. I will recommend it to my friends.	1
It is so hard this days to find maternity clothes that would actually look good and stylish. I'm 100% happy, it fulfilled all my requirements. Comfortable and my favorite pregnancy top by far!	1
There really isn’t much about this product to complain about since it works in as much as it supports my neck. I just wish that it was bigger though.	1
This piece is smaller than I expected, but fits the price. Great for organizing all types of jewelry. The workmanship is a B- grade, but that's basically what you would expect from the price.	1
This is poorly constructed, difficult to raise up and down I expected small but this is Toy land I was using for my grand children anyway I would not put this in anything but the basement playroom. This is not a sofa bed for adults too short.	1
These tags are super cute and adorable It is hard to fine unique luggage tags!! If your looking for luggage tages, look no further, they are made very well and sturdy. seller was great.  product arrived very quickly!!!	1
The Tissot has a slightly heavier(more-substantial) feel/weight to it. However, I'm very pleased with the finish and detail. I have small wrist (6.25&#34;) and this watch (at I think 40mm) doesn't look too big. But I wouldn't want anything larger. I was concerned that the observation back would make it sit too high off of my wrist, but that isn't the case. Overall it looks good.	0
Excellent leather strap is high quality very well defined, very stylish, comfortable and luxurious, easy to install as it comes with l stainless steel adapter that allows you to slide easily,   Skyla fascinates me to use prodcutos high quality.<br />I recommend it	1
Our old cutting board didn't have the "ring" around the outer edge.  When cutting juicy items (ie: a large turkey/chicken) you would end up with a mess on the counter.  Also the "diamonds" in the middle do a great job of holding the item in the middle where you want.  We've not had it long enough to speak about durability, but it feels nice, strong and solid.  And in the function we cared about most, it keeps the counter clean while being used.	0
Very heavy duty. I installed them with my lift so I can't compare their effect on handling but I'm convinced they help with drivability.	0
I love these shoes!  I bought a pair of these shoes from DSW probably around a year ago and have worn them out because I wear them all the time.  I originally was looking for new black flats and then thought maybe I should check Amazon to see if I could find a new pair of the same flats.  Lo and behold, I found them!  They are slightly narrower than my first pair, but I'm not sure if this is a change in how they're made or if my shoes used to be that narrow and have just gotten stretched out from wear.  Either way, they are adorable shoes and I LOVE them!	0
Remember to wear safety glasses!  These safety glasses fit great and are comfortable to wear all day!  These safety glasses offer protection in all kinds of environments.  Safety glasses can be replaced, your eyes cannot.	0
Got this for my husband for Fathers Day and he is absolutely in love with it. It does a bunch of stuff I could care less about but makes it that much cooler for him. The design is nice and sporty but sleep and sexy at the same time. It curves around your wrist to make it more comfortable. It is very heavy for a watch but that should be expected with what this bad boy does.	0
My best friend gave this toothbrush for my son. I'm surprised with this magnificent product. My son really enjoys every time I brush his teeth and gums. This product is safe and effective!	1
We volunteer at an animal sanctuary and these vacs used there get a lot of tough use. Nothing fancy about these machines, but they last as well as could be expected and are light and very portable. The cloth filter is a cost saver and is easy to clean. Do wish they had fixtures on board to wrap the cord around.	1
Via the Amazon Vine program, I decided to get the Jerdon JGL10W Euro Tabletop Tri-Fold Two-Sided Lighted Makeup Mirror for my wife to try out. The magnification mirror we currently have in the bathroom is not real nice, and I thought this might be a good improvement. We found it has some nice features, but I'm not sure if it will end up being something that's used continuously.<br /><br />The magnification works well, and it works for both close-up jobs (like removing something from an eye) and makeup. She also liked the different lighting options. It's amazing how different the same look appears under various types of lighting. The styling was so-so, and a bit bulky to just leave on the vanity. The description talks about using it for travel, but I'm not quite sure I'd want to mess with it in a suitcase. The side mirrors fold down with no securing mechanism, so that's not very convenient if you move it on and off the vanity. As noted in other reviews, the item that seems to make the least sense is that the bulbs can't be replaced. You're basically risking a $60 purchase on a $2 light bulb.<br /><br />While it's a "nice to have" item, it's not something we'd purchase on our own.<br /><br />Disclosure:<br />Obtained From: Amazon Vine Review Program<br />Payment: Free	0
I usually use capo for practice so that it would be easier for me to get the perfect chords and note. This capo is perfect and seems like in good quality. Good deal!	1
The stand is not the best stand for the Flip if you shoot extended videos. It's good for short sessions. If the Flip needs to be angled, the stand doesn't hold that well and needs to be held with one hand to stay in place for handsfree recording. But the price makes it worthwhile for short videos.	1
These may seem pricey but they are one toy that is worth the money!  They are indestructible, large enough not to lose and fun for all ages.  I like having this set with the building base and carrying case.  We have two sets and added the connector set as well. You can also buy more complicated sets of instruction cards.  I love watching my preschool aged kids figure out new ways to turn and stack them and build new creations.  You can follow the direction cards included or freestyle.  They are a playdate favorite!  My tween and teen nephews and niece love them as well and always try to build lifesize towers.  Buy them!	0
I ordered this product to extend the range of the WII game console. I use it in a home theater and it seems to work great.	0

Cello prices are very expensive in the DC area string shops, and many of them are Chinese made (professionally set-up).  My daughter's school orchestra teacher told us she needed to move up from her 1/2 (used) cello and I thought about the quest to find an affordable ($650) first cello for her, we actually drove hours to another state and had to puchase a bow.  If my child was a serious string player who practiced and played for the love of the instrument then I could see spending the money for the 3/4, however my child doesn't practice consistently and this isn't a full sized instrument.<br /><br />The sound isn't as good as my child's 1/2, more muffled than clear, no ringing end notes.  We replaced the strings with pro-arte brand strings and noticed enhancement in the sound.  Good, not great sound enhancement.  The E string broke while the adult &#34;helper&#34; was tuning in chamber orchestra, the pegs are stiff and tricky like most new string instruments.<br /><br />Tip, don't purchase the more expensive perlon core style (dominant) strings with this beast.<br /><br /> I then purchased the prelude strings in the red package, now we are talking.  I had forgotten my own lesson with the first cello after we had first purchased it, get the heavy duty strings that last for students (and helpers) who are still learning to tune.  The sound is brighter with the new red pack of strings, you can hear the cello, especially since most students get the cheap strings that are &#34;brighter&#34; sounding for their violins that tend to drown out the few cellos.<br /><br />The bridge is very thick and appears to be carved from a 2x4, however it gets the job done with little finesse.<br /><br />Price is the selling point for this cello.  The price is right and it is able play after easy set up.  Sound is deep and mellow.<br /><br />***I strenuously suggest getting better strings!, the ones included are more fishing line than cello strings.	1
I had to return it because I mistaken order 100 instead of 150 for my Lexmark S515 Printer.  It should be 150.	0
i have been using earth's best organic whole grain rice cereal for my two kids and never saw any negative in it,they love it and this motivate me to buy it for them.	1
The statue is a very small castled mold not hand sculpted and made of a very flimsy and fragile looking blackened cement or sand-like material not stone. It is not worth half it's price. Very disappointing!	1
I got this guitar as a birthday gift. My girlfriend doesn't have great idea about guitar. She bought it for me. But I must say that this guitar is really a poor one! very bad sound quality. I tuned it properly. But still it sounds bad! I just hate this product! And it also doesn't look like new! It looks like used one! really horrible!	1
Great romantic movie.  This movie the whole family will enjoy watching.  Very heart warming .  I would recommed this movie for the whole family	1
Absolutely loved this little portable charger. Charger comes with two extra battery that allows you to switch when phone battery dies. If you don't have a case or don't mind take out the case then this is a very good product to go.	1
This book is an excellent story. I have really enjoyed it so much, I strongly recommend it.A great collection so far.	1
This product arrives on schedule, looks very bright, good to see that the dolphin drilled. It together with my phone is really perfect, I love it, it is always so brilliant. It has a very good value.	1
These invitations worked very good for me! Blank with a nice touch of decor. I used these for our baby dedication with my 9 month old. Invited a lot of family & friends at the church. Was well enough room to write all the info I needed. Thank you!	0
I'm addicted to this show, I watch it while I'm working on the computer and as much as I can during my free time. great show, great writing with a great cast of characters.	1
It comes with 2 colorful pages in the beginning. The quality of printing is awesome. I have been a fan of Sailormoon since I was little and was dying to get a proper manga collection in English and yes these books didn't disappoint me. The translation is very good, especially the helping pages in explanation of extra terms (Japanese term/culture) used in the book so readers can understand more about characters' action and dialogue.<br /><br />I can't wait to collect all of them. These books are way better than the old ones. Good job!	0
While you are searching a cheaper priced ink, this one is perfect. Installation is very easy and the machine correctly reads the colour levels. Much recommended for the cheaper priced cartridges.	1
Pros: Concept of a case with an attachable strap to work as an armband. That's really about it.<br />Cons: Silicone material does not work well for work outs or running, except maybe very light workouts. It sticks to the arm with no flexibility to allow free movement of the arm. I usually run 3-4 miles followed by 25 minutes of strength training. This armband was painful to wear for more than a mile. When I removed it after the run, the skin is flaming red in that spot.<br /><br />Maybe it's just me, but I think a more flexible material that doesn't cause so much friction would be better suited for this design. This material in itself is too painful to wear.	1
I don't reallly leave too many reviews, but this one stood out. Great selection that has allowed me to figure out what works best for me. I had several of my friends try them as well, and they couldn't see the difference between these and some of the more name brand and we couldn't tell the difference. Really a great Amazon deal. Thanks!	1
This is a very dark, but beautifully told story. I consider it a bit of a guilty pleasure. Certainly not uplifting material, but fascinating. It appeals to my fascination with understanding aberrant human behavior.	1
very nice bag at a nice price. has a nice shape that lends itself to some creative packing. lots of take homes.	1
Not as loud and has a High Pitch to it. I wanted it to be deeper tone but it is louder than a regular horn. I mounted this on my lawn tractor and it is pretty neat. I use it to scare the birds and harass the neighbors. You will need to order wiring and a horn button.	0
We wanted a TV that had a nice picture for a nice price.  We've been pleased with our current Sony TV, just needed one a little larger.  We ordered the first TV and the box and TV arrived damaged.  We figured this was just a fluke so we returned that one and ordered another TV.  The second arrived more damaged than the first... all the Styrofoam corners were smashed and the box had been punctured at the bottom, breaking the area of the TV where the stand sits.  We returned that one and went to a B&M retailer to purchase the TV.  It appears that the damage is occurring in Amazon's warehouse before being sent to the customer, as both times the box appeared to be punctured by a forklift and then re-taped over that area.<br /><br />I highly recommend the TV, just purchase it from somewhere other than Amazon!	0
I had seen this type of mop advertised n had the other kind that had the spray. When I received my mop and used it l loved it. It was so easy to use and the mop head dies a great job. I have two cats and now does it do a great job on the floors,  it also picks up the cat hair. Now I do my floors easily in one step.	0
The buttons are extremely hard to press and the case looks really cheap on my phone with all the bubble effect on top and bottom on the back.	1
I'm a little shocked.  This furniture is better quality than I thought it would be.  I expected the fabric to be more hard like a canvas.  It was much softer.  I wasn't feeling well so my wife put them together.  It was no difficult for her and these thing are usually not easy for her.  It's solid furniture that I feel good about having guests sit on it.<br /><br />PROS<br />- Sturdy/good quality<br />- Good color combination<br />- Easy to assemble<br /><br />CONS<br />- Cushions a little lumpy<br /><br />- Review done within thirty days so don't units haven't been weathered<br /><br />Shipping:  It's shipped through a local trucking firm.  If you have a good firm you will have a good experience.  Ours arrived very quickly and he placed it exactly where I wanted it.	0
This is very cute. I love this pretty earrings. I love to buy more of this for my sisters and nieces.	1
I thought I was getting a NEW phone. This phone is not new. Didn't come with an SD card, the book that was in the box is not the book for this phone. However seeing as how this is a replacement phone the book is not needed I have two already but that's besides the point. The battery is crap and It doesn't do the same things my other ones did. I am so sad I was really looking forward to having a new phone that worked the same as mine did. LOVE the HTC Evo 3D phone and don't want to get any other kind but this phone was listed as NEW, and its not. Very disappointing. So	0
The detail and size of this art piece is great, I can imagine this set on my wall right now. This is something I could look at for hours on end and never get bored with. The 5 panels could be spaced differently giving the art work a new look time and time again. I really do love this set and would happily display it at home.	1
I have only used this blu-ray player less than ten times and now it won't read discs. I am so tired of buying electronics off of these sites and they last maybe three months. Just long enough so that you can't return it or get your money back.	0
I love it.  It's well made, roomy and attractive in my opinion. I have two blankets and a large wooden tray in it (and there's room for more). I  use it as an ottoman and as a coffee table (with my tray on top when I need a flat surface for drinks).  It's very functional, nice looking, and a great value..	0
nice and heavy well constructed plane, no frills though all adjustments are by eye, good quality for a very good price! recomend it for someone doing small odd jobs!	0
I purchased this book for research purposes, hoping to get a fuller picture of life in Stark county. This book described, in detail, the problems and triumphs of Stark County, including church splits, political struggles, attempts at integrating one culture into another.

Picture this... a vast hurricane is overtaking Eastern United States of America, it is ravaging the coastline tearing down homes left and right leaving a war path the world has never witnessed.  In the final hour of Eastern Coast humanity, the sky's part and a beam of light shines through directly onto a single piece of chicken that has been marinated in this scientific formula.  Upon the first individual spotting this beam of light 400 miles away, they walked until they reached the savory destination of roasted chicken.  Upon one bite the destruction was gone and Chuck Norris stood triumphantly holding onto baby jesus shooting beams of healing light.. Yeah I would say the marinade is good.	0
winner,winner,winner.....the best for price ez up available, i have tried 4 different types/brands and this one beats them all.....high quality materials and workmanship....solid design...super easy one man set up and take down...comes complete with stakes, wheeled travel and storage bag....true size 13 x 13 feet, straight legs....vented roof	0
We have 4 dogs, two who love the squeeker toys and two who are afraid of them.  My review is for Min. Schnauzer who is 11 but acts like she's 6 mo. when presented with a "squeeker" and my male black lab who spends hours and hours just laying and squeeking.  The lab takes his ball everywhere he goes and in addition to a New Year's noise fest, he uses the ball to tell us when he wants out of his shed/pen in the mornings and 10 minutes before supper time.  I'll have to say that I agree with many of the reviews here in that the squeek doesn't last nearly as long as it should but he's now well past the stage of chewing up the entire ball so we do get a little milage out of it.  As he takes it everywhere with him, he tends to leave it in the most unusual places (rabbit scents come calling) on our 20 acres.  The bright yellow makes it much easier for us to locate. Our little Schnauzer likes the little balls and although she is quite a little squeeker, her big thing is playing throw and chase either with herself or with us. We have been supplying their ball habits for several years now with the Kong balls and will continue to do so as we get as much pleasure just watching them and their fun.	0
We bought a two pack of these a year ago to replace a broken set.<br /><br />we liked them so much because when reaching into the container we have in a kitchen drawer to get them out, these wount &#34;stick&#34; you.<br /><br />so we replaced all of the &#34;old ones with these.<br /><br />we also &#34;mix and match&#34; the colors for fun when we have guests, brightens up the table!	0
Good price, guess this is the reason for the strong smell of the shoes. I have them a few weeks now, finally it starts to fade a little...	0
This is just what I needed.Easy to pass the time, used this product guests say good. This is a great invention!	1
I absolutely loved my MIU glass bottle. It was perfect for me to take to class and work! I used it every single day and had fun trying different types of loose leaf teas for each day. The glass was sturdy and the lid sealed tightly. It came with a bottle brush, making it easy to wash. Thank you for such a good product.	1
I use this on our table, on our granite (sometimes) on the floor for quick spills, on her booster chair, it really is a whatever cleaner. I have however noticed the price went up on all their products after it was featured on Shark Tank, what a shame.	0
Tornado Ice pours out clear!!!  it looks so cool and refreshing and once you try it you learn very quickly it is very cool and refreshing but finishes with a hint of mint.	1
Busy, have forgotten, sorry can I say ~ ~ lifetime can touch the boss of this shop, happy enough. Good quality, value for money	1
I Love this tea. It is a smooth, full bodied, kind of earthy tea. The price was good for the quantity of tea I received.	0
Very happy with this equipment bag. My son carries two gloves, two bats, warm up jacket and the bag still has enough room for to carry catcher equipment. The wheels are large and much easier to roll than most other bags. Highly recommend for any player at any age group.	0
This was a perfect addition to a long hard to furnish hall.  Now the hall is my favorite room in the house. Looks like a very expensive piece of furniture. Goes great with a round mirror over top.  This was the perfect piece for the room!	0
I read the other reviews and though this one was a good deal but actually not! Why? I used it during Christmas from 12/23-25. It shot for 38 photos and 6 video. then, it is out of battery! On the other hand, I used the original canon battery coming with the camera, it took 87 photos and 10 video from Dec 1 to Dec 16 before it showed out of battery. I am going to return it and go for a canon one even it is much more expensive! PS. my Canon camera is brand new, so as the original battery and this poor one!	0
Nespresso makes GREAT coffee and GREAT machines. I switched over to a Nespresso machine 7 years ago and have never looked back. I save a small fortune every year by making my lattes at home.<br /><br />That being said, the Nespresso capsule offers posted here are from a third party who is putting a large additional margin on their price.<br /><br />You can order the same products online from Nespresso for approx $0.55 each (half the price here).	0
This is my second Luminox watch.  After ten years I was just looking for a change. The first one still runs and looks great even though I wore it 24/7. They are sturdy, waterproof watches with great illumination - visible in any light or none at all.  The luminescent tube at each hour mark run around the circumference of the dial with a slightly different color (yellow) at 12 O'clock.  I assume that is why it's called "color mark".  The older watch has the hour mark tubes positoned along the radius (center to edge of the dial) with twin tubes at 12 O'clock.  I feel the later setup makes it slightly easier to read in total darkness.  That's not a big problem and I highly recommend this watch.	0
It's loud, clear.  Sound don't get distorted.  About battery life... uff, no words, I got 10 hours of playing at mid volume.	0
I remember when we went on a cruise last year they had giant bottles of liquor like this. When I saw this card my eyes lit up. Definitely the dysfunctional family size bottles for me. haha. I've got many other cards on here and I have nothing but good things to say about them, truly great quality at an even greater price.	1
MK has been one of my favorites games of all times and the Komplete Edition continues with the tradition. Great graphics, sound, characters.<br /><br />The only thing is that I can't remember the power moves for my favorite characters(SubZ and Scorpion)<br /><br />Must buy	0
My guinea pigs LOVE these willow branch balls. They play with them and chew them until they fall apart. Last about 3 weeks to a month.	0
Bought the brown gloves with cashmere lining. Very stylish - the brown piping adds a nice touch. Touchscreen function works very well. They fit as expected, though a bit snug. In temperature of mid-20's, my hands got cold within 10 minutes, so set your expectations.	0
This is a very affordable sunglasses. Nothing can beat the price. Really! It looks like expensive one but the truth is, you can have this not more than $4. It is great protection from direct sunlight which is ideal for summer and beach party. Love this!	1
Still Classic  sun glasses. They are great looking and are STILL great quality. They last a lifetime as long as you don't lose them.  lol	1
Even though they do seem smaller these would good stickers if they actually stayed on! For that reason, these are worthless! Well, unless you need colored paper dots.	1
Definitely does the trick I have a few friend who swear by this stuff. I'm not a big fan of the taste though	1
I still have no idea how exactly the maze worked, but my 7-yr-old niece loved it.  It was a much more entertaining way to give her some money for Christmas, and everyone else enjoyed watching her solve it.	0
Very disappointed. The bike was used only moderately but the plastic part broken in about a year for no reason. Looks like<br />bad quality but it's already out of warranty.<br /><br />Not going to but it again. Will try to find something else that fits.	1
This collar finally ended all of my frustrations with my 3 yr old schnauzer. Before purchasing the collar, my dog would bark uncontrollably at any person or dog she saw whenever I had her outside. After the first day, the barking got greatly reduced, this collar has helped out so much.	1
I was so excited to order this book as I have seen Debra Rothenberg's work and it is always amazing.  I was thrilled when it arrived and was not disappointed when I opened the package!  The book was more impressive than I thought it would be, and I had high expectations to begin with. The book itself is very reasonably priced so I didn't expect anything really high quality as far as the cover, etc. However, this book looks very expensive and high quality and is a great bargain.  The pictures inside are superb and although I have not read all of the stories inside, the first few I've read give background to the photographs that make them more real and meaningful. The way Debra has written makes you feel like you were a friend standing at her side watching the shows with her. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of Springsteen and it would make a GREAT gift for the upcoming holiday season.  Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!!!	0
Yes! mac n cheese with my shiritaki macaroni that's gluten free too!  AS someone who still craves the mac and cheese I got in the box as a kid, this is pretty close. I thought the salt level was about right - you can always add cheese or whatever you want to it.  Appreciate that the product is available.	0
They ride up a little on the legs but so far there's been no thong problems. Im not sure of the inseam length but they do seem a little longer than past boxer briefs. I bought them for my bf and hes constantly skating, so lots of squating, jumping, running and falling and his bootys not the smallest...so far so good. Before he would always complain about undies riding up no matter how loose they seem, these seem to do their job well. Nope, they feel fit and comfortable!	1
Straps work great for a variety of used - love that they are soft and do not scratch - these are nicely made and are a lot stronger than they look!  Great product!	1
I am very glad to have been approached by HCF to review their product.  I received, and started taking, HCF a little over 3 weeks ago.  When I got it, I was pleased to see the amount of literature that came with it—a nice breakdown of what it will do and how it will do it.  I started taking it in the evenings, when I take my other vitamins.  I did notice that for the first few nights I had a minor headache, but that passed within a week.  Obviously there is no immediately noticeable effect, but around the end of week 2 I started to notice a subtle difference in my ability to focus, stay on task and handle surprises.  Like other reviewers have indicated, this is not a magic pill that creates a dramatic moment—no switch flipped, if you follow me.  I've been struggling to find the words to explain it.  Before HCF, if I I was easily distracted from task on hand.  After HCF, I just do the task—no great epiphany, I am just able to focus on what needs to be done and do it without the distractions.  I find that my general outlook is a little bit sunnier—I’m not as inclined to become exasperated by changes of plans and find it a little easier to go with the flow.  Again, this isn't a profound change, just a nice subtle effect similar to what one experiences after a few weeks of taking a multi-vitamin.<br />The best advice I can offer is to give it a try and see for yourself!	0
I just put it together and really like it in my tiny kitchen. I'm using it for a microwave stand to get the space on the counter. Only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because I'm missing a &#34;T-NUT&#34; that holds the main assembly bolts tightly in place. There are 12 of them and they come screwed onto the bolts, but one of my bolts was nutless, lol. I'll upgrade to 5 starts if Linon.com gets me the missing T-NUT as it was an easy process to order. Just waiting to see if they actually deliver. It stands up fine with the missing nut, but would not want to move it around a lot as there is some play in the leg.	0
This one is sturdy. It stays in place and all the materials used on this music stand are quality-wise.<br />I love it! I also have a feeling that this would last for a couple of years. I hope it does!<br />Anyway, practice sessions and real performance of our band turned out to be great!	1
Square shape makes storage convenient, lids are very easy to seal,and remove, great for arthritic hands.	0
I love this shower head!!!! no problems so far and I'm so glad I bought it! I purchased this mainly because I live in an apartment where the shower head was mounted too low. This helped raise it up about 7 inches so that worked perfectly. Water pressure is great. Only complaint is that most of the different stream settings are useless and/or weird.	1
I bought this rug within the last 6 months but only started using it recently. The colors are vibrant and it layed nicely in the room I placed it in (over some worn carpet). The room has several antique pieces in it and the rug looks nice with them.	0
I, recently, purchased this product and I am very pleased with my purchase. I had read the reviews before purchasing and was a little thrown off by the packaging thinking that it may be difficult or messy to use without a traditional container. Despite my concern, I purchased it and it arrived just as it is pictured. Very neatly packaged, not messy.<br />It is a great moisturizer. I shower and put it on while I am still a bit damp adding a dab of castor oil and my skin is soft and not greasy. I use the shea butter only on my face - no breakouts, face is beautiful and soft. I will definitely purchase again.	0
I had one before but a friend talked me out of it so since I had given mine away when I saw this I knew I wanted it.  Do yourself a favor and part with just how many bucks to buy this. It's a brilliant very inexpensive tool you'll use every day and it makes life just that much simpler. Thanks for the good service.	1
This product is amazing! I bought 2 for some of my germaphobic friends who travel alot. They love it! They were excited that they didn't have to wear hoodies on the plane to protect them from other people's sweat, dandruff, etc (YUK). Yep, going to order me one now. Oh, and they loved the red and black colors. High quality material also.	0
For the price, it's a great product. Some of the smaller hex keys fall out of their holders, so just be sure to push them in tightly.	0
I have thick hair that gets in the tub/shower drain, gets stuck in the pipe, and clogs it up. These don't catch all the hair, but they do reduce the volume of hair that gets down the drain. When the drain slows from accumulated hair, I pour white vinegar and baking soda down the drain, wait 15 minutes, run hot water down the drain, and then I use a plunger on top of the drain to create a vacuum and push any leftover clog around the pipe bend, so there's no more obstruction and the tub drains fast.. Between these drain protectors and that cleaning method, I don't have to clean the drain often and I don't have to use toxic products. And at the cheap price for these (and they're  biodegradable), I can replace them when they get more built-up soap scum than I like. You can also clean them in the dishwasher, or soak them in water and a little bleach if you like.	0
It is a nice little travel guide that helped me to prepare for my trip to Sochi, it is all in English with some useful maps that explain where is what, incl. the olympic venues. I recommend it to anybody who wants to visit Sochi, the region or the 2014 olympics.	1
While I thought these were going to be great, they ended up being less than what I wanted. The quality wasn't as durable and thick as I thought. Having to buy all of the bulbs was bad enough, let alone not being very sturdy. I would think twice about purchasing something like this. There are better options on the market.	1
I bought these in a size 10. I liked the look and quality of the shoe, but they ran a bit small sadly. I was so excited to wear this shoe because it is really pretty, just too tight. Unfortunately have to send them back.	1
i have not had any success with this product.  it's expensive and it feels good but honestly i don't see a difference.  i don't really see the point of it and now i'm going to try and sell it used.	1
Lately my body has been deceiving me going through a lot of medical issues so when I noticed my skin getting dry I figured I should try something.  I ordered the serum and it came in fast packaged well.  I started using it right away and within a few days I noticed my skin not as dry and just overall appearing healthier.  I have had no side effects either from using this product.	1
Very pleased with this luggage! We are planning to take it on a trip next week and it is deep, lightweight and the 4 rollers make it very easy to maneuver.	0
Was hard to find anywhere.  Amazon had it.  I am happy with purchase.  Looks great in our two bathrooms, we bought two.	0
It can't beat the original but it's okay. There are lots of twist in this version. The main character is good.. but the revision of the story isn't. It's a good watch though..	1
I've been using Sweetleaf Sweetener for more years than I care to mention. They've perfected Stevia a great deal since the early days when I would dip a toothpick into the bottle and still use too much. It's still easy to use too much, and I've gotten pretty good at judging when a whole packet is called for or whether to sprinkle out less into my drink or whatever.<br /><br />I grow Stevia, just because I grow herbs, and it's a nice plant to have, but I've not been successful at drying the leaves for my own use. Even when I grind them in the coffee grinder, the powder just floats on top of my drink.<br /><br />There are controversies over the use of Stevia, just as there are over everything from eggs to green tea. I just know I can't use the artificial sweeteners like aspartame as they immediately give me migraines, as does anything sweetened with corn syrup. I sweeten with Agave Nectar, Stevia, local honey, and occasionally organic raw cane sugar. These work for me. Mostly it's just a matter of trial and error to find what works for each individual, but I would vouch for Sweetleaf Sweetener, and I try never to run out of it.	0
She loved them!  These were a gift for a lovely bride and groom and they absolutely loved them.  Even the guy &#34;oooooooh'ed&#34;.	0
Martin Shaw's reserved homicide expect George Gently is a great foil for the period in history itself, early 60's England, when the Scandals of the Profumo affair and a growing cynicism with authority led to widespread police corruption and clashes between authority and youth. His partner, young John Bacchus, is on the verge of being a bent copper himself, with a penchant for abusing prisoners and cutting corners. Watching George try to keep Bacchus from making the mistakes other officers have made is key to how their relationship develops. The mysteries themselves are puzzlers and quite clever, with lots of red herring suspects and some contemporary undercurrents. A brilliantly written show.	1
I Was Always Searching For The Product Like This At,Last I Found This Product on Amazon.It is Actually a Great Baby Monitor Including All The Things And Features.The Sound Was Cool And the Video Quality Was Amazing.I Will Also Purchase An Additional Camera When I Have Another Baby.The Best Thing I Like For This Product is a Zoom Camera And Night Vision.I Also Loves The Quality of This Monitor.The Battery Was Also Very Good.Overall, It Works Great.I am Very Happy With My Purchase.<br />I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO ALL!!	1
There wasn't anything special about this item. The fit was OK, the raider patch could have been adjusted to sit a little lower overall just OK	1
We love this new shower-head from Delta.  Right out of the box this was easy to install.  Even if you haven't put in a new shower-head before, it's really quite easy and this one took just a few minutes.<br /><br />It looks very nice as the chrome and settings are of a nice quality.  There is quite a lot of hose presence so be prepared for that.  Once installed, this shower-head really does give an increased presence of water pressure as advertised.  When using both pieces together in standard form, you do get a sense of a heavy rain type of flow.  The pause button and detachable piece both work great.	0
Not really all that bright LEDs. I have the CR-025 model on my other vehicle and it is much brighter.	0
The shipment was extremely fast... The soap is EXCELLENT quality. And the size of the soap will last a lifetime. (well maybe not a lifetime but u get the point) lol	0
There are so many things that needs to be remembered. In this review the tips are a must read and I like the formatting and sequencing because it's not boring to read and is easy to memorize. Preparation for the boards simulation part is now easy.	1
It's working as expected.  A little disappointed with what the sites are offering but still a good deal.  Not ROKU problem if content is a little lame	0
No go. All the reviews are fake. Buyer be ware. I took it and I got blood in my stool. Stopped taking it right away. Look all the reviews are positive with the same thing to say. Same reviewer. If anyone really took it as i did you would write a 1 star review because no-one wants blood in their stool.	1
I love my inversion table.  When my back is hurting I get on it, just hang for a while, and it's all better.	0
I will never buy used again. The solution container on the top of the machine had a hole in it. The Machine is very noisy.this machine leaks the cleaning solution......Horrible wasted my money	0
Great futon cover and very soft and it's easy to remove for washing. I'm very satisfied with this purchase!	0
Econometrics is not for everybody, and this book is not for beginners. However, it is a great learning tool for advanced economics students	0
House is one of my favorite shows. I hate having to buy seasons separately. this box set is perfect to add to my TV show collection. a must have.	0
Holy cow! I really wan't expecting this to be great quality because of the price, but I am so impressed. This is a VERY sturdy, well made set. My toddlers LOVE it and we don't even watch Sesame Street.	0
I needed this product and it chipped quickly and it works very well why pay for brand name when generic just as good.	0
no... my dog loved them! she thought this was my food so she wanted it. i gave it to her and she continues to love eating them. they are special and she knows it. they are a very healthy food for her and they go along good with her diet. she loves some of the other dick van patten's dog food products also. this is just one more quality dog food product in the line of dick van patten's dog food products. keep up the great work of making healthy dog food products. i feed my dog her foods and treats in moderation too.	0
I was surprised at how small it actually is. VERY VERY SMALL. and the quality is pretty cheap (since you're getting it for a very cheap price). Was it worth?	1
This filter works great! The zippered bag that came with it for the dirty parts broke during our first use, but its just a cheap little plastic zipper bag. That was a bummer, but easy to replace with a bag from my kitchen. Other than that, everything works great as intended.	0
The picture quality at least was good while it lasted.  I had one of these for about two months and then the screen went black and I couldn't use it anymore.	1
These are the perfect size for what I ship and I like having the front of my envelopes blank (I don't prefer the ones with lines on them).  Buying them in bulk cut the cost down a lot.  Will definitely be buying them again when I run out.	0
Volume is just a little louder than a regular phone.  Worked o.k. for knowing phone was ringing while I was in the yard.  However, died after about a year.  Will be looking for a different model.	0
It's a very unique Swim cap, it has a greater quality than all of my previous swim cap that I tried before. I have been using it for months, it's really durable.	1
I have just read the product describe and it sounds exciting. I saw a movie about Galapgos's underwater world and I was really shocked how many animals live there. It is incredible! My favourites are the seals they are so kindly and funny!<br />My dream to travel there once in my life. I anticipate a good mark for it!	1
I purchased this Air Conditioner last month as a bed room air conditioner. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is it's such a pain to have it fit correctly in the window. The instructions are unhelpful and do not explain anything. When I did get it to sit correctly, I noticed it would not even keep a small bedroom cool on only 80 degree days. I tried everything I possibly could but didn't get any sort of result I was looking for.<br /><br />After talking to friends and family, I finally found an air conditioner that works AMAZING!!! I have never slept better in my life now that the weather has been heating up this past month and can't wait to sleep in a cool room all summer long!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY air conditioner, check this one out here on Amazon -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1hsKRDg<br /><br />It's not as cheap but is well worth the extra money, as it cools quickly and efficiently. Also, it's much quieter!<br /><br />If you decide it's not the air conditioner for you, at least I got to share my story about this one!	1
I got my package earlier than expected so I'm very pleased about that.<br /><br />The bags held their seal, and did not re-Inflate. I found that putting a vacuum hose to the valve instead of rolling it up as the instructions said, worked a lot better.<br /><br />The bags good size!! I could probably fit inside one of them.<br /><br />Very pleased with this product, I would buy them again.	1
Our kiddos not really a chewer but she will chew on this from time to time. It hasn't broke and will indeed reach her back gums. It is easy for her to handle.	0
Disclaimer: I didn't purchase these at Amazon, I review products not sellers - unless reviewing in a sellers' area.<br /><br />I saw a basket of these at the local Red Apple Store in Toledo, WA. I was visiting there with family over the Christmas vacation. They were $0.99 a for a single serving bag and I thought they look cool so I picked up one. They weren't bad, but they weren't what they claim either.<br /><br />They didn't taste like &#34;Birthday Cake.&#34; When I think of birthday cake I think of a chocolate or vanilla cake with thick whipped frosting and sugar sprinkles. I expect a vanilla and cream or chocolate and cream taste. However, all I got was the chocolate. They did taste like chocolate cake, I will give them that, but not like a chocolate birthday cake. They are larger than other MMs, and I'm not sure why. I really hope that MMs continues that flavor next year, but that they call it something more suitable like Chocolate Cake, Cake, or Brownie flavor instead.<br /><br />Positives<br /><br />-Larger Than  Normal<br />-Chocolate Cake Taste<br /><br />Negatives<br />-No Frosting Taste<br />-Go Stale Faster Than Others (learned the hard way)<br /><br />I would suggest that you only purchase these if you simply want a large or more chocolate MM not a birthday cake flavored one.	0
I used this blade to cut aluminum frames that were 1 inch wide by 7/16 inch deep in various lengths. The frames were used to make solar screens that reduce the amount of heat that radiates into the house created by the window glass , thereby, reducing the cost of cooling the rooms affected. The blade made a very smooth, clean mitered cut. I could have used a hacksaw and miter box, but I had 40 cuts to make, and doing it by hand was going to take more time and effort than necessary. This was my first time making solar screens, and using this blade assisted me in doing a really good job. I finished screens for 10 windows in a day. They are up and secured; they look professionally made and really do reduce substantially the transfer of radiated heat into the rooms. Thanks Freud for making a excellent blade.	0
Only used it one day so far and it's worlds better than propping up a few pillows. It's very comfortable and supports my baby and my back. I would recommend this to nursing mothers.	0
I reeeeally wanted to love this stuff.  I bought one for a teenaged niece, and got one for myself, because I'm a sucker for all things &#34;Hello Kitty&#34;, and I'd read reviews on another site saying it had a &#34;light, clean, fresh&#34; scent with &#34;fruit & floral&#34; notes.  Got it, and although the packaging is beautiful, and it will fit in my purse nicely, I found the scent to be VERY strong, overpowering, and frankly... like something an old woman might wear.  What's worse, I couldn't wash it off!!!  Even after 5 or 6 sessions scrubbing with hot soapy water, I STILL couldn't rid myself of that smell!  Turns out my niece didn't like it either. Sigh.  I see plenty of great reviews on other sites, so obviously others like it a great deal.  My advice is to try it somewhere first before buying.  Wish I'd done that myself!  Good Luck!	0
The Amazon picture looks like a blue face but it is black. The bezel is big but acceptable.Very easy to set up and use. I first charged it in the sun and it picked up atomic time the first night. The SS bracelet is very sharp and the bezel has some knurling around it giving it an masculine look.	0
Used this for a few weeks now and love it!  My husband says I'm never stinky like I could be with other natural deodorants that didn't have antiperspirant.<br /><br />Been very happy with this product.	0
OK...this a winner!!!  The scale paid for itself the first time we went on a transatlantic flight...the trick is not to jerk the bag up quickly.  Use a fluid, steady, slow lift and the reading will be spot on!  I verified it every single time with a &#34;Balanzza Digital Luggage Scale&#34; that I have had for ages.  With the new...well...not so new now...baggage weight limitations the scale alluded to what we had to remove from our cases...several times in fact...the first time out.  The travel adapters are a nice touch, but I purchased another adapter by Samsonite, here on Amazon that is self contained.  No &#34;snap in plugs&#34; to be misplaced.  The locks are a given.  I purchased additional of the same.  You can not buy the items in this kit individually for anything close to this package price.  I highly recommend it!	0
What a great watch with great features and a great price! Easy to read with a night light. Day, date and time at a glance. Readability, ruggedness, style and name back it up.	1
Easy to read. Doesn't bounce around too much. Pretty straight forward. I have had worse History books. The chapters are pretty long though.	0
Nice grill cover, however after 1 year of use it has ripped by one of the handles and now I need to replace it, will look for a better alternative.	0
I love my Panasonic TVHD.The best investment I ever made.The picture is so clear and the size is perfect, 55 inches.	0
Very nice, sturdy mirror with capacity for lots of jewelry storage. The inside of the jewelry holder could have used some better organization, given that the compartments are very large and jewelry tends to be very small.	1
Lots of info on the Philadelphia mob family of the 70s that is not found in any other book. Good stuff. Lots of info on AC. Great, underrated book. Check this one out.	0
Nice little lock, with a Four-digit combination that's easy to set. Feels sturdy in the hand, and should fit on any luggage. Ultimately, it's only as secure as the agent who might check your baggage, but the pop up indicator gives an extra layer of security there. It would have been nice to have this when bottles of wine mysteriously disappeared from our luggage, and we'll be using it to hopefully avoid that situation in the future.	1
My husband pestered me to buy this and I gave in. He's been so obssessed with this very violent game. But he's happy so I'm happy.	1
This is probably my favorite deck. it's more slippery than others I've used, but it's one of a kind. Very satisfied.	0
I just began using this product two days ago. We all lead so busy lives these days with not enough sleep which leads to more aging around our eyes and dark circles. The result after my two days of use seem to be making a difference in my dark circles. I am hoping that it may also lighten my crows feet. More results to come as I continue to use this product.	1
This well-made DB8e antenna is beautiful.  I love the plastic red caps that cover the ends of the bow ties. (It keeps them from getting bent out of shape.)  I love how this is basically TWO antennas that can be pointed in two different directions. The assembly instructions aren't the best, but I was able to figure them out. With this antenna I received 54 channels from 56.4 miles away (in one direction).  All in PERFECT condition with no dropouts or pixelation.  I was impressed, and this reception was from the inside of my attic!  Unfortunately, this antenna could not receive my favorite two channels 2-1 and 2-2, which I sadly learned are NOT in the UHF band, but are in the VFH-High band.  This antenna (as it clearly states) is a UHF antenna. If you want to receive any VHF-High channels you will need an antenna that is designed for those frequencies.  Perform an internet search for &#34;TV signals near me&#34;, and look at the FCC site and the TVFool site. Both sites are extremely helpful, and give recommendations as to the type of antenna you need and the compass-pointing information to help you aim your antenna to receive the strongest signal.  If you don't need to pick up channels 2 through 5, then this antenna will be the best antenna you ever bought!<br />I ended up replacing this antenna with a $45 model RCA ANT751 (bought from this site), and couldn't be happier. I now receive all the channels that my location can receive. (currently 56 channels total)  If you do not own a compass, there are some great compass apps for a smartphone that work great!  I am very happy to finally cut out cable tv.	0
I used these recently on an African safari where my camera was in almost constant use and the lens cap was being pulled and tugged all the time. These worked just as advertised. A friend had a different brand and spent a lot of time searching for his lens cap after the adhesive failed to hold. He said he was going to buy this brand when he got home after seeing how well they worked.	0
I have been looking for ear buds to fit my tiny ears, for ....literally.... years. All ear buds I have tried in the past have popped out of my ears. Even the ones that are supposed to hook around your ears didn't fit. I have always had to use over the ear bulky headphones. I saw this product and took a chance. They are FANTASTIC! Not only did they stay in my ears, I can even cycle with them! Sound quality is really good too! I may buy an extra set - one for work and one for home!	0
It's smaller and not as well made as my Graco, but for 50 bucks I didn't expect it to be great.  It's was more padded than I expected.  I had it delivered to a friend's home so my daughter had a place to sleep when we stayed there.  Setup was easy, there are velcro tabs to keep the pad attached to the frame, and standard pack n play sheets fit fine.  It's perfectly serviceable.  It doesn't come with all the special parts that the Graco has, two levels, changing station, etc.  I just needed it for a portable crib, and for that purpose it worked just fine.	0
A squirrel chewed through the bag the first time we went camping with it.  It is lightweight -- but I was expecting it to last longer vs. the critters -- especially since it's marketed as a campsite trash can.	0
We were very excited to get this luggage, Well, we now have two pieces with the telescoping handles broken off from normal wear and tear, they bend very easy and can no longer be pushed back in to the luggage, the handles are not strong enough to handle any amount of weight. We complained to the Manufacturer direct with no satisfaction, we now only have the two small bags left after only using the two larger ones once to travel to the Caribbean. Would not recommend for the long trip.	1
I love the smell of this! I've used this a few times when I've been sick, and I don't know if it's just this or combination of meds and water, but I've gotten better faster those times! Plus, it makes the whole house smell great!	0
i had bought it 2 weeks ago but didn't find time to start i started practising this week and i have already started feeling great the exercises are easy and burns more calories than yoga. i am looking forward to buy her hot body yoga i hope it's available on amazon soon as it is the only e- commerce site i trust i am really glad to be a member of amazon.	1
I have a 2nd gen Macbook Air and this is the second Thunderbolt to HDMI adapter I've purchased.  The first one didn't have audio out, hence the reason for getting this one.<br /><br />Build: not quite Apple grade in terms of plastic quality and cord flexibility, but it is of pretty good quality.  I got this so I can plug it into my TV and leave it alone, so it really doesn't matter.<br />Function: works just as advertised.  Picture is perfect and audio seems clear.  If you're having trouble hearing audio, check your System Preferences: Sound, and make sure HDMI is selected.  Sometimes you might need to log out and back in, or restart the computer, after the connection is made.	0
This is adorable for a fun look -- this was a gift for a 5 year old to use at her desk -- as well made as any task chair, but much more fun!	0
I really like this towel. It does exactly what it's supposed to do. It's really compact and fits in any bag.	1
XS pills work on so many levels, and I think that's due to the green coffee and tea extracts that are in them. My body has reacted really well, meaning I just feel energetic and chipper all of the time. And of course I've lost weight, too, almost 30 pounds in just under 2 months. All in all, I love everything about these. Would definitely buy again.	1
Techno man loves this, you must be committed to track all of your food but it is a definite morale booster to see your activity and weight going in the right direction.	0
Wonderful product! The size is just right, the quality is excellent. It is bright and cheerful. My 1 year old loves it as do my 7 and 8 year olds!	0
This is my favorite little light,,,,is super bright,,,,compact,,,very nice built,,,, i let my kid play with it,,,,,very robust drop it couple time and no damaged or even a scratch	0
Love this little booties are. Super cute and seem to be good quality- which I wasn't quite expecting due to the low price. thank you!	1
It seems that these stickers are made with the lowest quality ink because the colors look faded and it tends to rub off. Very poor stickers that i would not buy again.	1
Good things DO come in small packages!! Initial charging takes a couple of hours and then you are good to go. Set up for my iPhone and iPad mini took less than 20 seconds. Portable, durable, and supreme quality make this speaker my absolute favorite of all bluetooth speakers. Comes packaged with everything that you need;, cables for charging, and a carabiner. With Up to 5 hours playtime powered by an internal long-lasting rechargeable lithium battery,in addition solar charge can really do work. you will not regret choosing this perfect, portable speaker. Love it!!!! .	1
In the remake of the movie "The Producers", when the Leo Bloom character quits, he turns in his green eyeshade and his Dixon Ticonderoga Number 2 pencil. Yes, these pencils are that good - good enough to be recognized in song by the lead character. And as good as their yellow painted pencils are, these black painted babies are so much better. Better erasers (soooo soft) and better finish (soooo not slippery). I have a bunch and keep them around, with extra sharp points to attack crossword puzzles, do some number crunching and, of course, finishing that all important doodle.  Yes, Faber-Castell makes $10 (not a typo) pencils WITHOUT erasers, and they are darn nice pencils. But for the price of a couple of those, you can get a year's supply of these and be just as happy.  If you use pencils or your kids use pencils, these are the ones to have. They may be the best pencils in the world!  Certainly, they are the very best value.	0
We love having this thing!! I use to help my daughter fall asleep in the stroller, and its perfect while outside!	0
As a San Franciscan who makes it a priority to shop local and organic for food, this book has inspired me to do the same when it comes to fashion.  One of my favorite quotes from the book is "Be purposeful with your shopping."  Going forward, this book is inspiring me to do so without compromising my love of fashion.	1
This is partly my fault since I printed the pictures off of an inkjet printer, but should the ink really just slider off like this? It's like splashing a perfect image on to the paper with paint. You don't expect it to stay as it is.	1
Disclaimer: Like every sharp objects, be careful in handling this product but this is totally awesome product I got as part of a promotion.  This is a must have for your kitchen and also very good for peeling of fruits and vegetables.I am so delighted that I was able to have this peeler because aside from it's great design, it is also sharp but really safe to use.I enjoy using it in my kitchen as well as my husband.	1
We ordered this for our little boy's nursery and love it! It arrived on time and it great condition. It is really sturdy and looks a lot more expensive than the other corner bookshelves available. It probably took my husband about an hour to put it together. Overall great product!	1
I was hoping for a pouch that was deeper or wider in the interior. I have ordered other pouches listed in this way, and I've been happy with them. IF a person wants a narrow pouch, this will work.	1
These are perfect for sitting on the porch and enjoying your morning coffee. However they were not the easiest to put together. The holes that are pre-drilled were not lined up correctly making the chair unstable so we had to red rill the holes on our own.	1
Wonderfully well written and produced movie that will move you. Never gets old to watch this film. Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson....	1
My son absolutely loves this teenage mutant ninja turtles toy. It mixes two of his favorite things TMNT and cars. It seems like he is always playing with either the motorcycle or the actual action figure. He has a ton of fun with it. I would ventrure to say it is one of his favorite toys.	1
Handle is great size for gripping plus enough distance from wall to allow for even larger fingers.  Thus, great for any age or need to ensure stabilization getting in/out or up/down.  Good length, too.  Sister-in-law is using in an rental apt so she can take it with her.	0
This is everything you expect in a duffel bag. It is light weight, has lots of zippers and you can get easy access into the guts of it. I like it because it is plain looking. I like that and so does another hundred people at the baggage claim. You want to put a big band sticker on your bag to find it easily. Or a big screaming patch. The bag is great though.	1
This is the best, It works amazingly well, I am a very Satisfied customer! I would never use anything else and I HIGHLY reccomend! A+++	1
The first one we recieved did not work and the replacement one we got does not cut straight. We have not had anything good come out of this machine yet	0
This piece is very low quality and very difficult to put together. It's not sturdy, and had to buy extra screw to keep it nice and tight. It took several hours to put together, didn't even finish it in one sitting and am pretty damn good with my hands. I am disappointed with this piece and do not recommends it.	1
I have had this less than 2 months and it has become dry and brittle and has ripped in several places. Unless this is for garage use or occasional use I would avoid it and spend a little extra.	0
The sword is well balanced. It's made by condor so the blade is sturdy and will last a lifetime if properly taken care of.	0
The filament design is really cool and they look just like antique incandescent bulbs.<br />These fit in the light fixture in our family room and provide as much light as we need.	1
Loved this concluding film in the Dark Knight trilogy! Yes it is not as good or fast paced as the prequel, but its still pretty good. I only wish they cut down a little on the narrative and made it shorter. It required too much attention to the dialogues, some of which were hard to understand. Anne Hathaway was a breath of fresh air!	1
We took the old hard drive out of computer and used this enclosure as a second hard drive on a new computer.Makes it much easier to transfer data<br />with the benefit of being used as a back-up drive when finished with the<br />transfer.	1
Alex and his gang are hilarious in the latest addition to the Madagascar series. Nice circus theme with the french lady inspector adding great adventure to the story. Kids and adults both laughed out loud watching this one!	1
This made quite the difference for me and allowed me to get some much better results. I highly recommend it.	1
There are small things that I both like and dislike about this product. I am using one for myself and purchased 4 for family Christmas presents. We are using the tall water bottles and I expected the same results with the &#34;coffee&#34; bottle.<br /><br />I purchased several of the wide mouth bottles with hydro flip cap specifically for hot drinks. I am disappointed that my coffee does not stay hot as long as I had hoped. I love the flip lid and the concept that it is &#34;designed in Oregon&#34; too bad it is still another &#34;made in China&#34; item. Even pre-heating the flask I think my coffee is lukewarm within the hour when I have finished about half. On the other hand, we keep ice water in our other Hydro flasks for days... or at least through little league games and swim meets.<br /><br />Note that overall we are fans of this product, we have about 15 of the water bottles in varying styles. Plus the 64-ounce bottle and now 5 of the coffee bottle. The small mouth, regular mouth, and wide mouth bottles have worked best for ice water - while the small mouth bottle lid keeps breaking and does not allow regular ice cubes. My daughter and I really like the insulation feature that keeps this product from sweating on furniture. Ha!	0
small, comfortable,strong enough very good for camping battery is very good.<br />this chain saw is good for cut small trees, difficult for dry trees with is a lot in forest.<br />i recommend this chain saw for garden cutters.	0
I regularly choose the Watts line of fittings for my PEX plumbing jobs. The fittings fit snuggly in place, and the crimps always make a perfect seal. I have installed thousands of feet of pipe with the fittings and never had a bad one.	0
Really cute little outfit.  My daughter went crazy for this for her American Girl doll.  The detailing on the sash is great.  I can't speak for the quality of the garment because she hasn't put it to the test dressing her AG dolls yet, but so far so good!  For the price paid, I would definitely recommend this.	0
Tried quite a few so called "gaming headset” but all you get is the regular once with no extra sound boost or other gaining tweaks. I found this headset the perfect ones for me. The design is perfect, the cushion heads are incredibly soft and don't get my ears itchy at all. It covers my ear properly so the sound doesn't leak out while I'm playing. I really like the adjustable mic, it super sensitive so I don't have to scream out loud. The cable is also quite nice and long. Over all, I'm very happy with my buy.	1
These are very nice everyday casual watches. I would purchase this item again, if they had a larger variety of colors. The stone sparkle very nicely. I well-constructed rubber watch. Hope it last!!	1
I purchased this socks last week and am glad that I did.<br />These socks are so warm no need of winter shoes, these socks are keeping me warm with a regular running shoes.	0
I use these for building fences, arbors and decks for customers and have experienced no problems using for these sort of projects.  They were replacements for a Porter Cable 18v ni-cad and these work just as well and they are certainly easier to use all day as they are a lot lighter.	0
I’m taking care of my grandma’s cat now and he’s really old and won’t eat as much solid food now. I have to mush them up just so he doesn’t starve. I wanted this one to work but he didn’t even sniff it.	1
Want to make your pictures look more professional?  Get these filters, they work great for adding that high quality look to any picture whether you are a amateur or pro.  And you can't beat the price for what you get.	1
I like the design a lot.The product was exactly as the picture, nicely made, with nice backlight. It has all the functions as described, and I like that I can set time for a different time zone, as sometimes i got confused with time for my friends and family on the other side of the world, and it's a pain to check it on the phone. This watch made my life easier.	1
Picked this up at the electrical show after getting a demo from Andrew. If you use a regular hole saw to cut in your lights I would recommend one of these. It costs less and does a much cleaner job.	1
Only giving this 3 stars because it is so cheap. Has a very mild sedative effect, other than that it's pretty useless for stress/anxiety/panic attacks. Save your money ad get some ZenRx.

The shredder works great. Even better when you feed a sheet of paper through with a little oil on it, every so often. Speed is fast and I can shredder up to 14sheets of paper (2 more than specs :)). It shred paper to very thin slices. However, it's a bit bulky for my limited office space.<br /><br />For a more compact version which takes in less sheets of 8, try below<br />http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0050BPWBQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0050BPWBQ&linkCode=as2&tag=justckem-20	1
I just got this today. I purchased 6 gallons one and when I received the box, box was beat up and when I opened it, it had so many dent that lid was so hard to fit. It's gonna be difficult to open and close every time I use it... I can already tell..... Kinda disappointed....	0
After read the review of JJCEO, I recommend to my friend bought it. I have used it on birthday celebration and found the quality of this camera is amazing! There is a lot of features available including: Take photos, selfies, videos, record music or voices, able to play your game apps, read your email, browse the internet and upload to social media after instant edit photos. Everything is working smoothly. We are surprised due to the advanced technology was over our expectation. Hope this review is helpful.	1
The truth is Sega hasn't couldn't escalate after Genesis. In fact, Sonic had to carry them & Nintendo was the one who made Sega popular by being their rival; which Nintendo was & STILL is light years ahead of washed up Sega so it was no comparison.<br /><br />Sega is aware of how crappy their company is cause in the 90s they swore they would never team up with Nintendo; but now they barely make just games instead of garbage systems & even team up with Nintendo so once again Nintendo would save them. The only good game in the Sonic series was Sonic 3+Sonic & Knuckles & that was just average. Sonic 1 was ok but overrated & lacks replay value, Sonic 2 was extremely easy & overrated as well, Sonic 3 was too short & a waste of time. Instead of just going ahead & releasing the full game of Sonic 3, Sega wanted to make a money grab; the other Sonic games pretty much sucked.	1
I am not one to write bad reviews, but this one ended up working after I operated on it.  The mounting plate covers the connection areas for my TV, maybe just mine, or my brand but I had to cut and hack to get it to work and the latching mechanism that is supposed to hold it up is weak at best and I keep having to tighten it, I think mine has a weak spring that keeps compressing more and more.  It also sort of hold the TV perpendicular for viewing, but the friction mechanism that is supposed to counteract the weight of the tv when viewing is also weak and it ends up inching itself back about 5 degrees.<br /><br />But for under $15, I feel bad complaining.  That said, you will need a way to cut steel to make this work on some models.	0
This is a fantastic yard tool.  It is great for picking up grass clippings and leaves.  It makes that chore much easier.	0
Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities. Over the years, as actual shave product technology improved, I found I had less need to use after shave products. Now that I'm older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance. So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Dove post shave balm for men.<br /><br />I don't have a regular shaving routine. Some days I go with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUK Edge Shave Gel, Extra Protection, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)]] and my [[ASIN:B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]], some days [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe Shave Gel, Shield, 7 Ounce]] takes the place of the Edge, and some I use my [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]], maybe wet with gel, but usually dry. It's just how I feel at the moment. I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I've used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave. A little goes a long way and when massaging it in, you can almost feel like it is soaking into the skin. It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth. The scent is slightly effeminate, I felt, but it isn't particularly strong and doesn't linger very long after application. I used this balm in tandem with [[ASIN:B00A0J09GG Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel, Chilled, Cooling, 3.3 Ounce]]and I think it leaves my skin just a little less greasy (but the Axe product is fine too). A similar product is the [[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]], which I use when I'm going to be out in the sun or on days when I don't shave (which are usually the same day).<br /><br />I really like this Dove post shave product. There's a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.	0
These slippers are so nice and warm! They're such an upgrade from anything I've had before and I love the rubber sole so I don't have to worry about slipping and falling (a problem with past slippers). Would rec to anyone needing something sturdy and warm for the colder months	0
How I love this Burning Wick Candle making kit, was so excited to make my own fragrance candle, it has an easy to follow instruction. I really enjoyed making a candle.	1
This is my 3rd Petmate 2 door carrier. They hold up well with constant use - I rescue cats. Top opening is a blessing when getting unhappy animals into & out of carrier.	1
I was skeptical about purchasing these jeans on amazon after reading some of the reviews, but the price was worth the benefit of the doubt that they had worked out the bad reviews of a few years back.<br /><br />I got my 501’s and when I opened them they felt like the same quality I have come to expect, the color matches the other pairs hanging in my closet, and they are the exact size I needed. What can I say, you either love or hate the button fly design and I am hooked on it, and I wouldn’t want to switch back to zipper fly’s unless absolutely necessary.<br /><br />Don’t let the bad reviews put you off, these jeans are what I was expecting and for the price they cannot be beat!	0
I have owned several streaming devices and this is by far the worse i have ever used. Will not connect and buffers all the time.	1
The quality of this underwear is really good. It is like those leading brands in the market. It fits well and it does not snug or anything like that. I washed it first and it did not shrink. I will recommend this to all. I received this for free for my honest feedback	1
This organizer arrived today and as soon as I opened the box I was completely DISAPPOINTED at how cheap it looked. I would have rated it NO STARS if I could have.  I have purchased many many acrylic organizers and this is the first time I have ever so sad about one that I purchased.  I will be returning it tomorrow due to it being extremely poor quality.	1
This is useful for when you have an extra guest and all the places for sitting are occupied. It's a little flimsy though.	1
Form:<br /><br />The TV has a red-Formica-chrome  look of the fifties.  I have a black and white kitchen with red accents and I thought the TV would fit right in but ,in actuality , the footprint of the TV is really too big  and looks sort of clunky and the silver plastic legs look a little tacky. There is a hand-hold in the top to make moving it easier.<br /><br />Function:<br /><br />I had never heard of the Seiki brand. I guess I'm a Sony, LG, Samsung snob when it comes to electronics.  The TV was easy to set up ,with on-screen directions ,and the picture really isn't that bad. It just doesn't seem that good for 1080p.  Because of the fixed angle of the screen the off-axis viewing isn't very good.  It has a plethora of connections but no headset connection.  The Yamaha sub-woofer gives better than normal sound for a small set.  Save your order number and Amazon offers thirty days phone support setting up your TV.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br /><br />If you're looking for a decorating fashion statement, conversation piece this might be the TV for you. If you're looking for a small TV (with headset connection) for your kitchen ,kids room or dorm room  you  might want to keep looking.<br /><br />note: After re-reading this review I can see I didn't add much helpful information for the TV but everything has been so competently and completely covered I don't know what I could have added.  It would have been helpful it there was a back view of the TV on the product page, showing all the connections, but I'm here to review the TV not the advertising method.	0
A fun and engaging game. My kids enjoy playing it together. They have gotten to the point they drive backwards!	0
Great desk.  Much better quality than I expected.  Sturdy and really great looking.  Plenty of dektop space.  Was easy to put together.  Took a couple of hours but not too complicated.  No damage in shipping.	0
Everything sea salt is so good!!<br />Crunchy and full of flavor.<br />Not to mention the branding is pretty sweet.	1
this product was excellent i am going to buy another one i am recommending this to everyone who needs an aux slot and only has a cassette slot	0
these baby rattles from Angel Dear are my favorite for baby gifts/care packages. i feel like stores always run out of these. so i was happy to find them on amazon. i'm going to order a bunch to have on hand.	0
While beautifully made, who wants a noisy slipper?  This style would be perfect with a suede outer sole.  This shoe is for someone who needs slip-on outside shoes and a pair of quiet slippers for inside the house.	0
I couldn't believe how small the box was when this rack arrived. My second Allen bike rack, this rack is made well and easy to install. My previous rack is meant for a trunk, so wouldn't fit my Honda CR-V, so needed this rack. It is easy to install. I haven't used it yet, but based on my other rack, am sure it will do well. Allen's customer service is great as well. If I should have any issues, I know they will help.	0
I know an anti-glare screen protector is of good quality if it not only removes the glare, but keeps the overall sharpness maintained. The IONIC screen protectors do just that. And they come in packs of three! Awesome deal!!	1
There are just enough needles to use every function of this pump; you can use the pump and the gage simultaneous in order to get the perfect pressure in whatever type of ball you are pumping. Highly recommended!	1
The finish scratches way too easily...will probably not last long. Update 7/3/15:  Already bubbled up on top from a cup being placed on it for a short time.  Oh, and more scratches!	0
We've had this for as long as we've had Gucci (our dog) so that's about more than 3 human years and it stills work well and kicks ass until now. Conclusion: It's a very sturdy and well-made leather dog leash.	1
I am not a sci-fi fan really and the commercials for the movie did not appeal to me as a movie I wanted to see.<br /><br />But after the reviews and the Academy Award nominations, I broked down and got this.  It is a wonderful movie in terms of direction, acting and the visual effects.  Blu-ray and the largest television in your house for this.<br /><br />Bullock delivers an incredible performance and you are immersed in the struggle for survival and have a sense of the vast depths of space.	1
As far as yeast goes it works but if you're used to Rapid Rise get ready for a wait. I make 5 minute bread all the time. Using Rapid Rise yeast it doubles very quickly. With this yeast it eventually almost doubles but it takes over 2 hours in my kitchen. I'm having a very hard time getting used to the difference. Since I use a lot of yeast I get tired of buying the little packets but even with this big jar of yeast I keep buying the packets because it's just too slow. I like to make yeast waffles (YUM) but I'd have to get up with the roosters to get it to rise enough with this.	0
The one I received had glue marks on the top where the sides of the leather meet the top. Poor craftsmanship especially on the exterior of the product. The corners were smudged like it was used. The good is it nice leather and the strap it comes with it is usable: However, this is a really small attache case and won't hold much being only 2.5 inches thick. Which is basically  just enough room to fill the internal dividers at the top. Otherwise it does not take much on the bottom of the case to stop it from closing. Also length and width is quite smaller too. 12 in. x 16 in.. I think I might of kept it if the quality issues were better. But it has limited use.	0
It was my 6 years old daughter birthday few days ago. She told me to bring her colorful balloons. I bought few but when I checked if they are weak so my daughter won't be disappointed , they explode very easily. But when I tried these,they worked great and there were so many colors. I am happy I bought these ones for my daughter.	1
very comfortable mattress!Such a good night sleep and an awesome price for it!it is much lighter to move than the traditional mattress. I would buy it again.	1
This camera takes very poor quality photos. If you are going to spend the money get a more reliable name.	1
Becoming Jinn is a beautifully crafted, carefully written tale of 16-year-old Azra who has what we all think we want -- the power to grant wishes (and I say this as a completely biased husband of the author but I assure you, every word is true). Azra is a smart, funny, caustic, bedeviling, and one-of-a-kind character rarely seen in YA.<br /><br />When the silver bangle is clasped around her wrist that provides this power, it's the final straw in a lifetime fighting the inevitable servitude that this precious gift will truly entail. Azra descends from a long line of Jinn -- what we refer to as genies -- and a strong incident in her past has turned her away from magic, her Jinn heritage, and her Zar sisters. Finally unable to escape, Azra is faced with the dilemma of becoming Jinn in a world of humans who she must hide her powers from and yet live among, including the terrific and self-depreciating Henry across the street and her lifeguard crush Nate. Azra must navigate the increasingly complicated world she now inhabits, learning magic, hiding her true self from her friends, and avoiding the Afrit, who rule over the Jinn and keep the wish-granting Jinn and their mothers separated from the males. As Azra's first-person tale unfurls, the author is able to demonstrate the frustration, fear, and confusion we all faced as teenagers and journeyed toward adulthood, jockeying for position, affections, and our rightful place, all with Azra's wry sense of humor and wit, which punctuates the book throughout. The book builds momentum to an unstoppable pace, beginning with Azra's birthday, through her wish-granting, and ultimately to the incidents that bring her full circle in her journey of accepting being Jinn. Barreling to the end, you will finish demanding that book 2 be released much sooner than April 2016!<br /><br />This is a triumphant debut by an author with a particular talent for creating believable and relatable characters, accurate dialog, and terrific turns of phrase. Even if the author wasn't my wife, I would recommend the book to anyone who loves good characters, humor, and a well-executed tale.	1
As other reviewers stated, this cat scratching post is not very tall or sturdy. To get it to stay standing while it was in use, we had to add 2 additional screws at the base of the pole. However, once we did that, it worked great! My cat loves it and has thankfully stopped using the couch to scratch on. My 5 year old cat is 14 pounds and has not destroyed it yet. At this point we have had it for about 4 months. For the price and easy fix, I would buy this again.	0
It is very small, but I like it otherwise. I would definitely buy it if it was bigger. I wish it would have told you how big it was.	0
I spent days going over the wallets -checkbook style and reading the customers comments. The reviews were very important in making my decision.  The wallet is fantastic. I have all the room for a wallet and my checkbook. The wallet is just beautiful.	0
This genuinely saved my family over $4000.<br />Car: 2003 Audi A6 3.0 Quattro.<br />Mileage: 85,000 miles.<br />Problem: Check engine lights for BOTH variable valve timing actuators sticking.  Condition present 75% of the time, so occasionally they would unstick.<br /><br />I put 1 quart of MMO into the oil.  I expected nothing, but for $10, why not.  Over the next 2000 miles, a miracle.  The check engine light for this problem would come on less and less until it stopped coming on at all.  The MMO cleaned and lubricated the heads (where the VVT actuators reside) enough to restore normal operation.<br /><br />I have never believed in a simple additive like I believe in Marvel Mystery Oil.  It is incredible.<br /><br />Update:<br />Now 2013, the Audi still has not had this problem come back.  Best fix ever.	0
The bag looks extremely dashing and stylish. Everything stands out in this bag – the front pocket, buckles, long strap and the top handle. It's a fun bag to hang out...feels just like my buddy. Ideal for school and office purpose.	1
A good moisturizer that doesn't stink! Not sure if it works as a good bronzer. I probably wouldn't buy it again.	0
These pants are great- the material is super soft, and the fit is decent, but two things:<br /><br />1. I agree with the other reviewers, these pants do tend to ride down a bit.  Typically pants are too tight in the waistband region for me, so it's odd having the opposite problem! But, I'd rather have that than the ol' muffin top look.<br /><br />2. The pants are overall a bit too big for me, so I can tell you that they are not nearly as bright as the image (stretch or no stretch), so I am going to assume that there was some post-editing foul play there.  Even though they aren't as bright, they are still beautiful!	0
Daughter loves it!  It was large enough to hold everything she needed for Disney World! Perfect color for her as well!	0
Great little spoon for my baby. It make my feeding moment more easier. My baby enjoy the fun while eating. The colors so attractive to her eyes.	1
Great to have in your house it does the job no its not electric and count if for you, you can't be so lazy about counting and you have to work a bit. small tip its usually much easier to count your own money, you may not see it as a problem. If you do count your coins properly you will see the benefits.	1
Really impressed with this product. Super easy to use and is very accurate. I am a home health nurse and I'm super impressed and use it all the time	1
I thought the book was pretty boring and sounded like the author was complaining about a lot of things in the book.	0
OKay, these are really cool. But the fire is huge and I really am not sure they are not dangerous when released! The instructions alone are worth the price of the order! The Chinese/English translation seriously cracked me up!! Beautiful when released!	0
I am overall pleased with the unit however it is nearly impossible to use without using the remote. Something as simple as pushing the "play button" on the actual unit and it doesn't play the Blu-Ray.	1
I was very disappointed with the purchase. I ordered this for my niece's birthday as she lives over 200 miles away. I could not believe there were missing pieces - obviously this had been returned previously from another customer.	1
The design of the briefcase with its  many outside zip compartments and end sections provides a wide range of versatility for the user.  In addition, the inside areas for credit cards and pens plus a small zippered storage area allow needed supplies to be easily organized.  The bulk of the inside room is open and can accommodate your own arrangement of folders, books and etc.<br />Long straps make shoulder carrying easy and the subtle leather provides an attractive presentation.	0
This is a sleek bag and the leather is of great quality.  It has plenty of storage in the front and back for chargers, mouse, an iPad, and notebook. I got the tan one and it seems it will go with just about anything. I like that the leather is soft and pliable not stiff like other bags I've passed up. All in all a nice piece.	1
no safe bike attachment with it.  Broke easily with my 35lbs dog clip pulled right out of metal ring.	1
This Nescafe with French Vanilla Coffee-mate is a good choice for a quick cup of coffee on the go. I am a coffee fanatic and typically love it in just about any form it comes in, so it sin't surprising that this tastes good to me.<br /><br />This is instant coffee with the flavor creamer already added so it is very easy to make. The directions call for 2-tbsp of coffee per cup but I use just a little bit more and that seems to work best for my tastes.<br /><br />The coffee is very sweet, which is the only real draw back since it can't be scaled back for individual preferences<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH	0
I am happy with this card.  It works well in my Sony NEX 5t camera.  I use an adapter so this card can work in both my camera and USB 3.0 adapter.  I am able to use the burst shot mode with my camera without an issue.  Slower cards don't let me take as many pictures in quick sequence.  I also have a Samsung EVO class card.  Its speed ratings are slower than this card, but for my purposes I can't tell the difference in speed (both cards are fast enough for my camera).  The Samsung is slightly cheaper and comes with an adapter.  I recommend it over this card because of the price difference unless you need the extra speed this card offers.	0
I do alot of brake jobs and when I saw this tool on Amazon I had to purchase it.This tool makes replacing disc brake pads easier.I've always used mechanics wire to hang the calipers out the way This is a much better way to secure those calipers.I give this set a five star rating because they worked very well for me and its very affordable.I highly recommend this product.	0
Way, way too loud. I don't even understand why this makes this much noise. I actually have to cut the gas down by about half in order for the sound to be bearable. I'm definitely getting something else, and I'll be returning this as soon as possible.	1
This is my third Ipad case. It fits my Ipad 4 great and I have gotten many compliments on the style of the case. For the price it is easy to be happy with all of the functions. If I upgrade to the next Ipad I hope to find a case just like this.	1
I use these on my 1989 Fender Squire Strat.  They work great to give a heavier sound.  They have the same look and feel as "non-heavy" strings, i.e. they have a heavier sound but they're not more difficult to pick; I notice no difference except sound.  These strings seem to last longer then other brands I've used before, a nice plus.	0
These are absolutely beautiful rose gold color earrings. They're so light and very well made. I got it from my wedding last year and they look very stunning. This is my favorite, I love it when people compliment me because of these wonderful pair of studded earrings! For every man out there, this is the best gift to a woman. :)	1
I like that this set comes with 2 speakers. Wattage is OK. The only issue is the short range. Not what I expected from a set of wireless speakers.	1
I bought 2 of these and neither of them are charging my phone now they just will not connect or i have to play with them for ages to get any sort of connection. i am now ordering another one from another supplier. i know it's not my phone with a problem as it charges perfectly fine with other chargers i have borrowed from friends. Not impressed‏.	1
[[VIDEOID:20708eb37a950de547970bfed8c2f9e]] This trimmer works wonders when it comes to trimmingh my Cockapoo. Normally I have a really hard time trimming him and this really seems to do a good job. My only complaint with this is, periodically, I have to stop during the trim, remove the attachment, and get the fur that is stuck. I am not sure if it is just my dog or what. It soesn't happen often but it certainly does. I love how this comes with a brush to clean up the blades. There are two different attachments included with two sides. Each side offers a different length. If you are looking for a quality pet trimmer, I would recommend this one.    This item was provided free for the purpose of inspection and review.	1
Nice light color and fabric for this coming summer.  Hopefully it will hold up okay with multiple washings. Really cute.	0
This vitamin C serum is easy to use with the pump. I don't care for the smell but it is light. It soaks in fast and does a good job to brighten my skin, I didn't think I could ever find a serum like this that wasn't oily but it isn't. It does leave my skin soft. I very much like the results which I would give a 5 but only for the smell I gave it a 4.	1
These knobes did not come close to fitting my fenfer teleocaster. and I was so mad I throught them i the trash.	0
I purchased two of these and two of them arrived in a timely manner with more than adequate packaging. I put some Celestion Silver series speakers in there, I found that adding speakers to the cabinets really boosted the performance of them as sound enablers. Only complaint would be the hardware, the screws were too skinny for the speakers I had and the sinks for said screws were screwed on instead of sunk into the wood. Maybe there was a reason for that, I'm not a wood/screw/screw sink guy. I've used them at a couple of shows now and have wound up standing on one of them on more than one occasion because hey rock and roll I'll stay up past 10pm, I don't care. Reasonably priced and functional, plenty of speaker cable in place in addition to an easy install for the speakers (I wound up using the hardware from my old cabinet, though).<br /><br />No gypsy curses detected, so A+ in that category.	1
I love this product! i got it a few days and it smells amazing! the one thing that i didn't like was the price, i think its a bit too much ffor the small size of this prodycuct. Think it should be about $6 per item not $11, otherwise very good!	1
We've had this scooter for 6 months and I have nothing negative to say about it. It is really well made and sturdy in<br /><br />addition to looking really sharp. My 2 year old daughter can ride it and I plan to pass it down to my baby boy when he is<br /><br />ready. Great purchase for the active child!	1
This four pack of microphones is really quite the deal.  I like having a whole set of microphones with only one receiver, it makes it really easy to do a quick set-up and take-down.  When they get clipped they stay clipped, right on the head where they belong.	1
I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased the Special K Shakes after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on the Special K Shakes and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.	1
Great looking, comfortable helmet. I get lots of compliments on it. I wear it as a bicycle helmet. When my friend crashed, then got back on her bike after cleaning up and shaking it off, she rode behind me and said she felt better just from looking at this cute, cheerful helmet.	0
individually wrapped and is in a secure tub. I use it in my chlorine tube attached to the return side of the  filter. 9 tabs last about 2 weeks and keeps the pool clear.	0
Love this product.  Protects my new Galaxy S5 like a glove.  Would buy many more in this color! Delivery was right on time.	0
Nothing better than adding the JL marine tweeters to your JL 6.5's. It dramatically increases the sound &#34;stage&#34; in my opinion. Sounds so much sharper/crisper. Easy to install as well.	0
Love it. The material is very nice and it fits perfectly in the iPad 2. I also like that the back and front are attached, it is not the magnetic strip like most smart covers.	0
The tech armor I phone 5 anti glare and anti fingerprint iphone 5 cover fits very good and works great.	0
This camera is just great! I was looking for an affordable camera that would save me some budget and still deliver some value. Then I stumbled upon this one in Amazon. It is perfect and black is my favorite color. I'm impressed by it's perfomance.	1
my sons nintendo didnt fit right, so it broke that same day.  It was very cheap material, I feel I should have just bought it at the store so that it wouldn't be such a hassle getting my money back.	0
This is the high quality and luxury mattress I ever purchased in last 8 years. It's comfort fell not like my old one with hard surface, that's the reason I bought new one.The design match to my bedroom and looks great and this time no worries for winter. Thanks a lot for making such a wonderful Mattress.	1
I  write this and threw it out because I think you would like to have something that can actually start your car, not just charge your phone. as long as your vehicle doesn't have a large engine/diesel, it'll start it, although it so thin.<br /><br />I work for a company, and while they provide jump packs for us, often a Jump-N-Carry 660 or something similar, sometimes they would end up being a little low on juice. So I figured I would buy a jump pack for myself.<br /><br />The largest engine I can remember starting was a 3.0L that was in a passat that had a drained battery. So for occasionally starting most vehicles, this will do just fine. Though starting vehicles in the winter is more difficult I imagine it'll still be able to start the same ones it can now, though I'll try to update this review during the winter.	1
Couldn't ask for more! Purchased those cheap-o stick-on large print stickers - those didn't last. Not only is the print larger than normal on this keyboard, but with the back-lighting, I don't even have to turn on my desk light at night! Seamless installation, I love this!	1
for my wedding i had to look for something which glitter and go with my gown and here i found that these shoe would do great,i purchased them and they are amazing.i love them cause they go even with some of my official outfit.	1
This is an excellent commentary on how God used these chosen women to fulfill his plan of bringing our promised Savior and Messiah into the world through the line of David exactly as He promised in His word. I was especially taken with the story of Rahab and how God chose a morally and socially unacceptable woman to carry out His plan and show how someone of pagan beliefs and circumstances can have faith and trust in the one true God who has the power to rescue and redeem all people from certain death. Excellent job by John MacArthur!	0
Previously I had purchased a so called professional model from a National Pool Suppy company.  Their POS handle snapped a few months after purchase, and the store refused to replace.  Needless to say I will never shop at Leslie's again.  This product is  a higher quality and quite a bit less.  Amazon is now my first stop for shopping	0
Very happy with this purchase. It was used and I haven't had any issues with it thus far. Crossing my fingers.	0
Like other reviewers stated, this bag holds a lot.  My school books, laptop, camera and lenses, purse, sweater, etc.  it stands well on its own.  Bought one for my school teacher sis.  Can't wait to give it to her.  Seems pretty heavy duty, even though the plastic fabric is thin.  We'll see.  Good product for price	0
Fantastic bargain for a pack of 50! I always buy from Amazon over K cup website because of the great prices. Donut Shop K cups are my favorite flavor. Perfect for any time of day.	1
I didn't expect to get a super high quality binder with this price, but at least deliver it cleanly and without scratches. Also, how can a binder only last 3 days when it isn't even being loaded up with a lot of stuff?	1
I got this for my '03 Honda because my lights were starting to get dim when I drove at night. It works great. I would say my headlights are 10 times clearer than before. When I saw the picture at first I thought it would be very hard to use but it wasn't at all. It comes with everything you need and this one is very affordable I'm impressed.	1
once upon time I was tripped over by  the mop, and wounded me badly. the day I saw this holder I bought it at once. and this hold my brooms and mops tight on the wall, no longer worry about the mops would lie on the floor and trap me. one more advantage is I can keep the mops dry instead leave it on the floor wet. I would like to give 5 star for this product.	1
I am soo glad I got these for my daughter!She is 1 years old and she loves them.These are great to have fun and educate your little one at the same time.I loved that you get 60 pieces total.Well worth the price.Your little one can learn their numbers,letters,& words. My daughter loves to stick them everywhere in the tub and she hates when bathtime is over.She really enjoys bathtime.We also use the flashcards outside of bathtime too which is great. She is learnin her words right now. We chose the boys girls because of the vibrant colorful colors they had. the girls option of colors is just purple and pink not very much colors to look at. it makes her bathtime more enjoyable. They are a very good quality foam and is durable.My little accidentally bit into a letter and it left a little indentation. But it did not tear or anything very durable. You get a lot of pieces for your money. Great for bathtime play and playtime play as well.	0
Note that this does NOT have a crimping tool in it as the description states. This seems to be an error on the part of Knipex rather than any particular vendor, because all the vendors claim it has it. See for example model 09 12 240 (the curved crimping area below the hinge), and the discussion here: http://www.electriciantalk.com/f14/knipex-09-08-240-a-53503/<br /><br />It's a really nice tool but overpriced considering the lack of the crimping mandrel. It's unfortunate that it wasn't part of the model design.	0
This book has a little bit for everyone.  Samurai, mutant warlords, and a little bit post-apocalyptic western, and non-stop action.  It's a great adventure and a fast read.  Definitely recommended.	0
The hard drive is defective. It does not detect on the USB 3 ports on my Mac or HP Server. Tried it on friend's laptops as well. Still doesn't work.	1
Really nice utility belt. Love the metal buckle.<br />I am using it for a holster and mag pouch and it works very well.<br />Adjustment is very quick.	0
Not disappointed a shopping ,want to buy it to start .The effect of post-installation results exceeded my expectations,very satisfied with the size of the installation and the fit is very good!	1
Previous Jawbone Up user here. I am someone who doesn't go to the gym to work out because of my schedule. Everyday I'm running to/from classes, work, meetings, etc. I like that a fitness device can track how many steps I've taken in a day and how many miles I've traveled throughout the day.<br /><br />I went back and forth for nearly two weeks trying to decide between the Fitbit One and the Fitbit Zip. I liked that the Zip was cheaper and did the basic functions (pedometer, distance) that I needed. I also liked that it was smaller. Yet I went with the One because I am actually interested in the sleep tracking function.<br /><br />I read many reviews and surfed through countless forums/debates on which device was better and why people liked one or the other more. Based on reviews from other women, I was worried that the Fitbit One would be more uncomfortable and inconvenient to wear simply because it's a little bit larger than the Fitbit Zip. I've had the One for nearly a month now and I absolutely LOVE the size of it. It clips perfectly on the fabric in between my bra (regular bra, not a sports bra). I face the LCD screen towards my chest and the clip faces front. I choose to do that just because I'm paranoid and feel like the actual device is more secure this way. Also, the battery life of the One is great! I can go two weeks until I need to charge it again.<br /><br />Why did I return the Jawbone Up band and stick with Fitbit One? Funny you ask! I actually loved the design of the Up band but I hated that I had to plug it into my phone every time I wanted to sync my data. I also wear a watch everyday on my non-dominant hand and I didn't like wearing too much on my wrist.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend the Fitbit One to anyone! I also LOVE that the MyFitnessPal app syncs with the Fitbit app! Kudos to you Fitbit, you guys know what you're doing...and you're doing it right.	0
I LOVE that these are &#34;Press-it Seal-it&#34; envelopes!  I love that they are sturdy, durable envelopes!  I have never had a problem with them, and these are the ones I buy over and over again.  Mead makes dependable office products, and these are some of the best.  I remember when I used to have to use a damp washcloth to seal Mead envelopes…this is a much more speedy and easy way of doing things!  I highly recommend them!	0
Well, let me see if I can find something &#34;nice&#34; to say first . . . the colors are pretty and there are quite a few.  It's actually my fault in not paying attention to the very short length of each ribbon, but I was shocked at how SHORT each spool of ribbon is here.  I could just barely wrap a single gift before the spool was gone!  If you are using this for a very small package then it will work fine for you.	0
Don't ever waste your time watching this load of garbage. Go grab the tweezers and pull your eye lashes out one by one. It will be less painful. Oh how the so called mighty have fallen, and still getting paid millions for such garbage.	1
This is replacing an all-plastic multi-spray nozzle for me, and this product seems very solid. I like the many spray patterns.	0
My 5 month old twin boys went crazy for this toy! They were fighting over it. Buttons are easy for infants to push and the music isn't that annoying.	0
Very Sharp, Great Build. Stabiliser works great. With a $200.00 rebate and as  I just bought A Fuji ex-1, it was an easy decision to buy it.	0
Found this unique monopod with built in battery charging for the Hero 4. Besides the great use of the monopod, I've to admit that it's inconvenient to replace my battery of my Hero 4 especially with the housing unit on it. This battery monopod allows my Hero 4 to shoot continuously without taking my Hero 4 out of the housing and replacing the battery. The large battery capacity definitely beats replacing standard batteries every time I run low on battery. Highly recommended.	1
I was disappointed with this watch. The diamonds are very small chips, and there are only a few of them. Most of the watch is covered in little silver nubs that are supposed to look like diamonds.	1
These rings are even more gorgeous in real life... the picture does them NO justice at all... the stone is a bit bigger than anticipated, however it's not so big that it's gaudy, or tacky looking... they are comfortable and fit perfectly, I'm a size 11 and they slip off and on with ease... will definitely be buying from this seller again!!!	0
short proccesung time, recieved within 6-7 business days. packaging was good. i would have purchased it with more confidence it there was more details about which models it will support. fit my fridge perfect though. thanks and will buy more from you again.	0
I love this tool!  I have a longhair mini dachshund, as does my parents, so we switch it back and forth.  It does such a great job of getting those mats and stickers out that can develop so quickly.  The dogs seem to enjoy it well enough, though not crazy about it.  I have the 18 blade for the doxies.  It's extremely well made - we've used it weekly for 5 years now!	0
Super good mans party dress, warm too for cold days. I god this for Halloween night but keep using it every other weekend.	1
Nice ring however be careful with the sizing as it tends to run on the small side. I placed orders for two other rings at the same time as this one all the same size and this one was smaller than the others.	0
This is pretty far from perfect considering that we really are not on the level where a robot will be completely interactive and reactive, but still, it's pretty good considering. I would recommend this to people who are looking for a decent little robot.	1
This has by far been one of the best purchases I have ever made. These masks are RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME. It is very easy to put on the face and the mask is truly concentrated with all the essential and natural ingredients as described. It smells so good too, It doesn't mention about cucumber but it smells like it. Very refreshing on the face, I left it for 20 minutes as advised and I could already feel the cooling effect of it on my face...and that was even just the first time I tried it! When I took it off my face felt and looked super clean and refreshed. I may be exaggerating in this review but it's in all honesty. You have to try this product to know...I mean, if you frequent the facial spa, you might be changing your mind as soon as you see this for yourself.	1
The Longevity Welding Armor M04-XL is made of the finest material from goatskin to high quality leather. This is why it will be a great investment for you especially if you want to really get ahead in the welding industry.  I have been using this for quite some time now and so far I can say that I don't have any regrets purchasing it.  It gave me the motivation to do the best job that I can because of the comfort it brings to my hands.	1
It takes up a lot more room in my apartment than I'm comfortable with. It's also poorly designed in that there's no place to attach a plastic bag to collect the recyclables you put inside of it. Also, when the crates are stacked on top of each other, it's sometimes too clumsy to put certain types of items into each crate's opening unless it's the crate at the top.	1
Sometimes the straps are uncomfortable , also wish they was a little longer, wish it came in a 54 b also but doesn't curl up which is a major plus	0
Excellent tablet for a Android device. The HD graphics are much better than any iPad for a fraction of the cost. It allows multiple logins so that you can have a separate profile for your kids that is locked down on the apps you want them to run, unlike an iPad. The display and memory options are fantastic I would buy another!	0
Awhile back I was having trouble with my computer screen. The screen would go dark. For awhile, I could move it a bit and get the light to come back on, but the problem escalated, so, after some research, I found that my video cable was going bad. The screen wasn't actually completely black. You could hold a flashlight to it and faintly see the display.<br /><br />Without any prior computer repair experience, I found a youtube video and disassembled my computer. The Compaq Presario CQ61 makes you work a little harder to get to the cable, but I found it and replaced it with this one. It worked! My screen still works about 6 months later. No issues (at least not the same ones).	0
Nice shirt althought I think I would have ordered a color other then white. However I do recomend the shirt for summer activities.	0
Great price and availability.  However, it is hard to give to a cat because of the pill form.  It would be easier if is were a capsule and could easily be stirred into wet food.	0
Can't complain about a thing.  It's simple... the battery fits just as well as the original battery does, it charges just as well and lasts just as long.  This isn't one of those shoddy deals from some unknown low-budget manufacturer, its a reliable battery that does what it says.	1
Great stickers and activity book.<br />My 5 year old nephew loves this book, and is still playing with it weeks after he received it.<br />Definitely a great present, at a great price.	0
Best cover and very easy application. It came with installing tools that made the application a breeze. The quality is great and I would definitely buy this brand again.	1
These have become my favorite. They are very strong, and while they grip the material well. Hold up even in high winds. Clothes stay firmly in place. No imprints left on clothes, well worth the price, highly recommend getting!	1
&#34;I would recommend this brand to anybody; seriously if you do a google search on them you'll find that the brand reviews are pretty good. My friend first got me onto this brand of product. I was skeptical at first but she showed me some reviews and the product and after seeing it for myself I was intrigued and decided to get it for myself. It was a good choice on my front!<br /><br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00WFQ9M3S<br /><br />Great price and super fast shipping. I've bought this several times over the past couple of years and it last just as long as the other brands.<br /><br />I like spreading the word so I also ended up posting this review on Costco's website, FYI. So far most people there seem to be taking to the review pretty well.<br /><br />Other than that, for what I use it for, no real complaints and I hope this continues being the case. I am very happy with it so far and I recommend you get the<br />http://www.amzn.gift/gp/product/B00CGBN7SI<br />&#34;	1

I love the cut of these jeans and if your waist size is a certain size, make sure you order that size.	0
Been using it for about 3 weeks now and I simply love it! I don't think there is any better company offering this quality for such price. Love it!	1
I bought this to extend the range of a handset on a corded phone.  Works well and performs as advertised.	0
deceptively simple looking device but great grill cleaning brush. angled corners allow you to clean those 'difficult to reach' corners of the cooking surface. scrapes off crud so the grates look great. handle has a nice grip and is heat resistant.	1
Such a simple yet useful selfie stick. Going in vacation this summer and this stick is all I needed. With it, I can film from any angle and it's super extendable (31.7 inches!). It's also compatible with many devices such as Apple products or Android phones. It's very compact, which makes it easy to store in my pocket.	1
I use the  conditioner and i fell, it is not better for me! that are new product, and is attempting to sell by providing false impossible promises.Do not buy this product or conditioner, Take my adversity.	1
Great Blu-ray player from Sony. This was a really nice upgrade from my old Samsung one, which I had to replace because the disc drive failed after 3 or so years of use. Hopefully this Sony unit will hold out better since Sony claims they have sealed the disc drive from dust and contaminates, which the Samsung was atrocious. This player has Wi-Fi built in it, as well as your Ethernet port. The Wi-Fi works great, and seems to perform better than my old Samsung player. Every app you can conceive of for entertainment delivery is available. You just simply setup your Sony account on your computer. From there, you can enable or add apps to your Blu-ray player. Since this a is a new model, Sony updates it regularly. The update process is painless and easy to do. Blu-ray play is great on it so far, and the sound comes out great in my Yamaha theater system. Overall, I think Sony is the go to for Blu-ray playback, and streaming apps work fantastic on it.	0
I have had these slippers for myself for 4 years.  This year I bought a pair for my husband and he is yet to take them off!  He loves them too!  Quality and comfort are outstanding !	0
I had a little trouble installing this on my  new Windows 8.1 computer. It turned out to be an easy installation, but the instructions on the disk seemed a bit confusing to me. But once I got the wireless hooked up and running, so far so good! A nice little machine for the price	0
These feel amazing! Nice eye masks for Anti-Wrinkle Collagen treatment! I totally feel like my fine lines and wrinkles are less noticeable! Great product and so simple and easy to use! Love that these come in a 10pk. Great quality product!	1
These are so awesome and easy to use it has no suction cups just static cling! Keeps the sun out of my toddlers eye so plus plus plus to this item!	1
One of the four chairs arrived crushed. The shipping box was not damaged so it happened in transit. They offered to send a replacement however the quality is missing so back they go. The other chairs have dimples, ridges, not of good quality. In this case you get what you pay for.	1
When I purchased this headset, I had been looking for a quality pair for a long time. I had tried time and time again hoping for something that sounded great and was comfortable on my head.<br /><br />Not only was this headset extremely uncomfortable, but the sound quality was horrible. After only a week, one side stopped working and I had to hit it to try to get it to work again. This was absolutely NOT what I expected after looking at the other good reviews.<br /><br />I searched again, asked around and finally found a headset that works now, and I love it! It has been about 2 months and it still works great. I can go hours at a time without them bugging me and the sound quality is AMAZING!<br /><br />If you need a QUALITY headset, go here ------&#62; http://amzn.to/1nsrbPn<br /><br />I promise, they are well worth what they cost. You cannot beat quality!!!	1
This is my second Brita pitcher. The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it.	1

every now and then i like to take my dog and groom him properly. The hair removed means it won't be left on the couch or on the floor. Nice grip that lets you use it with ease. Efficient in taking all the loose hair as well.	1
This item looks really nice.  Unfortunately, not one single piece was cut properly which caused us to have to scissor-cut every single decal!  Considering there are more than 90 individual decals on this set!  What should have been a 30-minute project turned into a 2.5 hour project.  I'm 9 months pregnant and did not expect to be EXHAUSTED when I was done putting up decals in my daughter's room!  I was highly disappointed in the quality of workman ship in this product.  It looks beautiful up on the wall.  Unfortunately, we had to go through a miserable experience to get there.	0
The reason we got this was to add a little color and life in our receiving area. Now, we just keep these in the deepest, darkest part of our kitchen drawers. The reason being is that they are painful to look at.	1
Easy to setup. Just a cat5 cable to connect out old Wi-Fi router with this EdiMax add-on. That's it! now our 2.4Ghz is 5Ghz! Its very useful for the one who wants to increase their range and speed. Good for home purposes especially for big houses like mine!	1
As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip.	1
Recently my One of  friend told me about this product, then I order this product here from amazon.But when I got this product I am little-bit disappoint the design the not so good.The designer take a look about this  thing I hope.<br /><br />But the colour really good.I like this colour.	1
I bought this book after a recommendation from Bill Gates who was told to read it by Warren Buffet. I would write more of a review, but with endorsements from those two I don't feel qualified to offer much more. Read this book if you are thinking of starting a business, or are responsible for the growth of your business.	0
I was going to use this punch on clear 15 mill vinyl, easier than leather to punch, but requires the punch to be well centered in the die or it won't punch out cleanly, instead leaving the infamous &#34;hanging chad&#34;. This was frustrating working with vinyl as  I then had to manually tear off the little punched out bit.<br /><br />Close examination showed the punch pin was not centered and was scraping on one side,, rubbing against the edge of the die and dulling the punch edge. I tried gently tapping the side of the punch with a drift in an attempt to slightly bend the punch pin to center it. This resulted in the punch retaining pin loosening in the jaw as its shank is slightly crimp bent and then simply pressed into the jaw, the bent portion securing it.<br /><br />The good: This is forged tool, rather than the more common stamped steel, and it looks like it should be good quality.	0
I love this watch so much because it is easier to read than a non-digital watch. I also love the color and it fits very good. I love it. by Leah, age 8	0
Well, it does what is say, and resetting check engine light took no time.<br /><br />But before that you have to make it work, and it took a while, especially properly setting it and then removing it.<br /><br />Initially device would not be recognized, so solution was to push it hard. Then good luck removing it, especially taking into account it sits lower in the port then main panel, so long tweezers/pliers  helped.<br /><br />the rest is history using Torque on android.<br /><br />One issue is that I could not find fault code, but this was, most likely, problem of free torque version, not the device (don't quote me on that thought)<br /><br />Would buy something longer and easy-removable next time.	0
I bought it for my boy , it fits him nicely and it is easy for him to read time .I love its simply style in black yellow color.<br />Shipping and packaging from Amazon is as good as always,nice delivering man.	1
The practice question guide for the National Counselor exam is really a valuable asset to have when preparing for this test.  It includes two sets of practice questions so you have ample material to test yourself with. You can also linking pinpoint the areas you still need to brush up on using the answer and explanation key.  The guide is definitely worth having.	1
Good Clifford book that lets a kid think of different things someone could be for Halloween. My only complaint was that 2 of the possible choices for Clifford were a witch and a devil. I'd much rather a book for a young one concentrate on more fun things to dress up as, but this book was written before all the worry we have now.<br /><br />My 2 year old loves it and asks for it even after Halloween is over.<br /><br />For those interested, other possibilities that I can think of off the top of my head were: Indian Chief (not too great a choice, but again, written many years ago), Knight in shining armor, and a clown.	0
This belt works well when combined with diet and exercise. Don't expect this to do all the job. It does burn like hell though!	1
In the past I have not had great luck buying shoes from Amazon.  They often arrive looking different than advertised, but I was NOT disappointed with these.  Comfortable fit, durable, and I really like the waterproof feature.  (It is also great that they have the extra wide sizes.)  I ordered mine a half size larger because they only had 3E width, so the extra half size made-up the difference.	0
This product company say it that it is a very good cream. But it didn't work properly. I just hate it.	1
Junk! Only people who like it are probably paid for it. We had 2 weeks of complete frustration. It did not go off when it should, and went off when it shouldn't. The funny noises that &#34;rotate&#34; were a nuisance. We gave up and got something for less than half this things price, and that worked well.	1
Not the same shade of green it appears in photos. In the photos it looks like a normal, primary green or maybe a forest green. In actuality, it's a VERY bright, neon green. So.... yeah, doesn't exactly match with anything else in our nursery decor, but whatever. The kid is probably just going to pee and poop all over it anyway.	0
Needed a new bell, shopped around, read all the reviews and decided on this one.<br /><br />What do you need a bell for - obviously to tell you someone is at the door. Its portable base/ringer unit works well all over the house (if I take it with me) and in the garden so I can sit outside and enjoy the weather and still know if someone is at the door. Choice of ringers is not the widest on the market but lets face it I dont need a smash hit to play to tell me I need to answer my door I just need to know!	1
This is a very good tool to take the back up your watches and put your batteries and then taking them to the store when it would cost, more dollars to just get the back off your watches and by the batteries thank you.	0

Properly sturdy jump rope. Feels really well-made. It's small enough to carry around in the included pouch. The best jump rope I've come across!	0
Excellent game! The graphics are awesome and the gameplay is superb! John Marston's arresting and often humorous storyline definitely makes this a game worth playing.	1
It arrived a lot quicker then I expected and my daughter loves it. She wears it all the time since we got it.	1
Works great for our Jack Russell/Dachshund mix. He figured it out on the first day. If he starts barking like crazy now, we just put the collar on him and he stops immediately. It's the only thing that has ever worked on him.	1
Really small When packed and fits me we'll at 6.1 and 200 lb really comfortable. Perfect set up with my  hennesy hammock for extra warmth	0
This painting lovely and fits my home perfectly. This gives it a nice western touch and I would recommend any pieces of work from Charles Beckendorf Gallery!	1
I am no professional when it comes to studio lights but these lights work for what I need now.  The Interfit lights are nice and a good buy for beginners.  I use yougnuo triggers on both and they have been working fine.  Lights are constructed well enough for my current needs.	0
This thing died so fast that I had to check how long I've had it before it choked. Less than a month. I've had this for less than a month. If it wasn't a gift, I would have been very pissed.	1
this thing ripped up the back after the 2nd time putting it on im sorry but it cost way to much to return so i guess ill keep it poor making	0
These sport laces are of great quality and I have been using it since a long time! Fits perfectly for all types of shoes and does not show any signs of wear and tear. Also, they are tangle free! Best sport laces available in the market!	1
I have been in the process of growing out my hair, I took clippers to my hair back in January of 2014. Yeah, don't ask.<br /><br />I have been taking this for a couple weeks now to see just how it would work for me. First, let me just say yes it does work. I had to get two trims at the nape of my neck since using this product.<br /><br />Because this does grow hair, it truly grows it everywhere. I have also noticed other body hair growing quite faster than normal. I have to pluck my eye brows more, and have to shave my legs more frequently as well. So just be aware that this does target hair growth... all hair.<br /><br />These are very easy to take, about the size of a normal vitamin pill. The smell is a soft vanilla with no aftertaste.<br /><br />I am still currently taking these, and I am enjoying the results that so far I have been given.	1
I was expecting these to be helpful in moving furniture, but these exceeded my expectations.  They are truly amazing.  We put them under our 7-foot air hockey table so that when the &#34;big&#34; people were playing on it, the cheaply constructed table legs wouldn't snap--instead, the table just moves.  So, they've saved our air hockey table from an early death.<br /><br />But, in terms of what they were really designed for, these super sliders make moving heavy furniture a snap.  Seriously better than I had expected--put these under the feet of the furniture and very little force is needed to make the furniture glide smoothly and easily across our Berber carpet--no snags in the carpet and almost no effort to push.<br /><br />I highly recommend these.  (We also discovered that Meijer seems to carry these if you need them instantly and if you live in the Midwest where you have Meijer stores.)	0
It was for bad weather for school...the PVC was busted within 3 days.  But with teenagers what can you do!	0
I was so excited when this series came out and disappointed when it was canceled so quickly. I have enjoyed all the episodes and really like the entire cast. Very happy I added this to my DVD collection.	0
A wonderful and absolutely refreshing smell!!...we have been  using it for over a long time in our family and we find this candle really very useful..the smell has a relaxing property.	1
I am satisfied with the perfect replacement battery for my laptop, at a fraction of the cost that I would have spent at the local electronics store. It lasts about 2.5 hours after fully charged	1
perfect because it keeps toys from floating away and also acts as a toy in itself. you can then teach your kids to help put toys away and and easily remove for stoarage.	1
Amazing!! High quality! I am very happy. The size fits me well and I feel comfortable. It is perfect! I like it very much. My friend also said it is very very good.	1
While the personal groomer works, the shaky construction quality doesn't inspire confidence. Also the brow shaper lacks a plastic guide - good luck shaving your eyebrows freehand without looking like an electrical shock victim.	1
This is a great formula and Country Life thus far has proved to be a good product and assimilates well.  Nice to get all three ingredients in one as they all benefit from one another.	0
For those that wonder how you can use this with a mic that needs 48v phantom power on a boom pole heres a photo. Its light and effective and you can plug headphones in to monitor.	0
Great product to use Under the seat Chevy Silverado back seats, helps to organize tools and equipment and other things.	0
This is an excellent pack for the money.  The large top pocket keeps many things handy, and the belt pockets are extremely convenient.  It seems to be very well made. It fits me perfectly, although I suspect a taller man would need a  different pack.<br /><br />I read in another review that camelbaks would not fit in the H2O pocket/hydration sleeve. That wasn't true. My 2 liter camelbak fits fine, and I think there is room for a larger bladder. The straps and belt are comfortable and seem to distribute weight very well. I don't think The back is very well ventilated and I wish it had side pockets, but I think I will like this pack.<br /><br />I will update this review after field testing but I wanted people to know there is no problem with camelbaks.	0

Performances = 3-1/2 stars; DVD production values = barely 2 stars.  Overall, very fine drumming especially for the first and last sets.  Impact is significantly reduced by minimally creative camera work and unimaginative video editing.  Highly repetitive shots (which exclude some performer close-ups) seems to indicate that an inadequate number of cameras were used and only a single recording of each set was made.  Audio is an insult to the performers!  Stereo only.  Poor placement of microphones and/or inadequate audio editing results in a loss of stage sound from front to rear--only instruments up front (or close to the front) can be heard the best or at all.

This is a great system for getting your kayaks up out of the way, and still have easy access to them. My wife can raise and lower the kayaks by herself.	1
I have been using these for more than a year now. I certainly have not had any of them snap, but the most use they see is on the end of an electric impact (~1300 in-lbs). My biggest gripe with them (and the reason for 4 stars) is the finish. They seem to rust even in mild humidity. I got rained on during a job once and even though I dried them off (on my pant leg), they still rusted like any other tool that had been submerged for two days... I'm fairly certain that these are just bare, possibly heat treated, steel.<br />My lesser gripe is their length. They add about 1&#34; of unnecessary tool. Some might like that, but if I want an extension, I can add an extension, I can't add a reduction :P<br />Still, for $5.25 delivered, I'm happy with these ones. I'll probably do some shopping though when I need to replace them.	0

I bought this camera used for $179 from Big Value Inc.  I was going to return it because the jog dial was really stuck, as if there were some gunk down inside it, which made it pretty much impossible to use the manual settings. Everything else about the camera seemed brand new.  I monkeyed around with that darn dial for a few days and it did get a lot better, but still has a spot where it sticks. To use the manual settings, that jog dial must work perfectly or else the settings jump all around as you are trying to set and adjust them.<br /><br />I had it packed up; Amazon and Big Value approved the return.  In the meantime I bought a more appropriate camera to reproduce my paintings, so I really didn't need the manual settings in the Kodak anymore.  Anyway, I never did return this Kodak and I use it constantly now because of the powerful zoom and wide lens.  It's so convenient and I'm not worried about abusing it at this price.  I don't care about the manual settings now because I'm using it in auto mode. I had searched the reviews here for the term "jog dial" but no one mentioned it.  I don't think people buy this camera to use the manual settings, and the problem I had was most likely because it was used.  It's still quite a nice camera for the price.	0
Of the set of 3 brush heads I bought from Amazon, the brush began to &#34;spread out&#34; within 2 weeks of use.  This was the same for all 3 pieces in the set.  I then bought the next set of replacement brush heads from Target and the first head has lasted 2 months so far.  I cannot tell whether the Amazon ones were counterfeit or there had been a product improvement by Philips; the markings on the 2 sets are different.  However, I'm inclined to buy only from Target from now on.	0
This cuddly panda is just the exact teddy my baby always wants to see around her. I love the unique design and quality of this Paci Buddy Panda because it gives a baby the right support for growth.I recommend this product!	1
I'd been running around 35 miles a week and couldn't increase miles because of soreness and mild injuries.  I've been doing this yoga for 6 weeks now and have seen great results in strength and flexibility. I've been able to increase mileage without any injury or pain.	0
I began caring for light sensitive plants as an experiment and hoped that this product would help. It did not and my plants died as a result of the continuous replacement of bulbs. The bulk of the blame is on me for not knowing better, but the product is certainly not worth endorsing.	1
I thought that it was working at first but it turned out to be a lousy idea. The group just flicked their ears at me.	1
I love this steamer.  It takes seconds to heat up and very powerful. I got rid of my big steamer and just use this.	1
I would not buy this if you are a grown adult. Maybe for a teenager or younger. The headset is so small that it has not fit my friends or me in our 20's. It's almost painful to have on after 30 minutes of gaming. While the sound quality is incredible it is not worth the discomfort.	1
This socket is something unbelievably useful. It is a new hit in my office and I use it for my laptop, phone and I charge my smartphones everyday. Never had any problems, this is a really useful product. This deformed socket is one of my favorite products ever!	1
Not much to say except they're a good value, and they look sharp.  They don't vibrate like the stock mirrors on my Rebel.	0
I wanted a very basic case for my new iPhone 5. I am not rough on phones and didn't want a bulky case.I didn't want a screen protector either because I have not been satisfied with the feel of any I have tried. This case is perfect for me. I was looking to have something easy and good. My iPhone looks very nice. It is so beautifully designed and protect my phone very well. I get a lot of comments on the high resolution print and the vivid color of this case.	1
Very well made stove and is very easy to operate. The autoignition worked quickly every time. Comes with fabric type carrying case that should keep it clean, but will not protect against physical damage. The manual is a little hard to understand due to the very poor illustration photos, but you can easily find demos on YouTube. Very good value.	0
I recently ordered several of these rugs and they are beautiful! Much better quality than I thought they would be. I will be ordering more of these if the price stays this low. I really can’t believe these are only 99 cents.	1
This Sony DVD player is a very inexpensive option for a second or third home DVD player. We put in in our children's playroom for movie watching and it works fine for that purpose. This is not the choice for a main DVD player as it lacks any wifi capabilities for streaming Netflix, Pandora or You Tube. It is also ideal for a vacation home or furnished rental property. When it comes to DVD players today this one is as basic as it gets.	0
This is a really nice $30 watch that has not proven to fail me yet. I have taken it on half a dozen camp trips and hikes.	1
In an effort to reduce our cable bill and provide us more choices, we elected to get rid of our DVR cable box and purchase the TIVO box.  After purchasing the TIVO box we were able to not only turn our cable box in but also eliminate our HBO channels.  The suggestion portion of the TIVO shows us shows we weren't aware of as well as channels we didn't even know we had.  The only thing I would like to see change is the way in which you can delete programs from the TIVO box.  It is time consuming to have to go into each individual program to delete it.  If that is the only complaint I have then it is ok.	0
I have to agree with the previous reviews here and call this product rather overpriced. They simply do not seem worth the money being asked for them, certainly not with the content that is being offered.	1
way better than that plastic thing that came stock on the jeep and its paintable to match or leave it as is. one of the best buys I have done yet.	0
I bought this pellets for my bunny. She sometimes nibbles and plays with it. I found that she likes it and enjoying eating it. However, im very allergic to the dust this pellets have. When my rabbit chews, fine powder is all over the floor. When I clean it, I had to sneeze and itch all over day.	1
Used once and it works well. Gets nice and hot, doesn't leak water, got the job done. Decent price too.	0
I LOVE THIS DRESS,IT FITS ME JUST FINE,I WISH YOU HAD THIS DRESS IN WHITE,BECAUSEI WOULD BUY IT,BY THE WAY DOES IT COME IN WHITE	0
OMG! This is the olive oil of olive oils. I have never tasted anything like it. I don't know if it's that it is a single variety of olive, or very fresh according to the harvest year printed on the bottle, or just the land on which these olive trees are grown. This oil adds extraordinary flavor to anything you put it on and trust me, you're going to want to put it on everything! The website also shows the lab analysis, so it may be that it is so high in polyphenols. Love the burlap bag that it is delivered in. Will be giving these bottles as gifts. Thank you Menelaus for bringing a truly exceptional olive oil to the market.	1
this product said it fit my 2012 Toyota Highlander but obviously it's  not made for this car. It's  took  me and hour trying  to line the hitch to my car and finally  I realized it didn't fit. the holes doesn't  line up. Luckily I Amazon prime free return Shipping.	0
A good product for my family, I have purchased and replaced all the light bulbs for my family, replacing the old products. This product is very bright, stable and not Harmful for eyes.

I recommend you buy this product<br />Thank manufacturers!	1
I bought this waffle iron 2 years ago. There is now a major problem: the non-stick material is flaking off and adhering to the waffles. I will have to discard the appliance because it is now unsafe to use. Will not be using this brand again.	1
It is a very helpful awesome product for your loving dog. You can adjust the settings to alter the timing intervals of the shock, as well as the strength of the shock. highly recommended...	1
When I read the reviews, some said that the plastic gears broke. I purchased the product and used it on some pork tenderloin. It maxed out on the thickness, and some pieces were more than one half inch in thickness. The cuber took the pork through with out any problems. The meat was just the way I wanted, and I won't be purchasing cube steak from the meat department anymore. This product is well made, thick and durable, and does what it says it will do. I would recommend this to anyone.	0
I got this whole tub for my cat who loves these things. Very good buy for me! Ended up paying about half price per toy as I normally do. They are about the size of a ping pong ball which is perfect.	0

Works like a charm...it was packaged nicely and looked just like it appeared on the marketing page.  I like the price as well.	0
I love the Oeuf Sparrow crib yet couldn't bring myself to spend $800+ on a baby bed. I searched everywhere for a grey crib with a modern ascetic. I finally came across this Hudson crib and knew it was the one. My son's name happens to be Hudson making it that much more fitting. The wood is sturdy and of very good quality. The grey color is beautiful, although a little lighter than the Oeuf.  The open slats on all four sides make it airy and comfortable for baby. It took us about an hour to put together and we had no problems. There are 4 different mattress height options. The crib sits low to the ground which makes it easier to get baby in and out without breaking your back.  It comes with the toddler rail which is an added bonus. You have to buy it extra with the Oeuf at $200+. I am so happy that I found this crib. I would recommend it to any family.<br /><br />UPDATE: At 18 months my son figured out how to crawl out of the crib. I was so glad we already had the toddler rail as we had to do a quick change late one night to prevent my little guy from breaking his neck. It was beyond easy to unscrew the front panel of the crib and attach the toddler rail. It took us all of 10 minutes. It's a huge transition from the crib to toddler bed (for both baby and parents) but it was made so much easier because we could continue to use the crib he'd been sleeping in from the beginning. I am still so glad that I chose the Hudson crib over the Oeuf. It has held up very well and is in great condition after almost two years. I expect that we will continue to use it for at least another year or so.	0
My pup just isn't interested, and when I squeezed it hard enough to crackle (trying to convince her it was fun) the plastic just collapsed and got stuck :(	0
This was the solution to charge all my usb devices, my camera, my tablet, and my cellphone, all of them at the same time. The two other ports are for my computer. this invention is very useful. What port should you pick its your choise.	1
Very disappointing. The author chose not to use quotation marks which seemed weird to me, especially with so much inner dialogue. Sometime I didn't know if the main character was speaking or thinking and had to re-read in several spots.  It just seems lazy to me and I don't understand why someone would use this format. That's not why I'm giving the book 2 stars though. The author seemed to create a fairly realistic world, but then totally dropped the ball in several spots.  For instance it seemed like nearly every character spoke like a redneck. Maybe the author is implying that only the rednecks will survive... Ha ha, but I don't know. The girl, a 15 year old that can't even remember what the world was like before it all happened leads me to believe it's been at least 10 years, yet she is able to find cheese crackers on a shelf in a store. I'm pretty sure that after 10 years there would be no food on the shelf and it certainly wouldn't be eatable. She was also fortunate to find Coke in a few occasions. Never Pepsi or Dr. Pepper.  The most unrealistic thing about the book was that she was driving all over the country filling up her gas tank whenever she ran low.  I found this totally unbelievable since most gas stations would be empty after 10 hours, but here she is 10 years later.  Anyway, the story was just okay, I liked the 15 year old girl and even cheered for her. Several characters I could see clearly in my mind.  The author has talent and I enjoyed his descriptive writing style, just not the story.  I had to force myself to finish and I didn't like the ending.	1
It has plenty of room for a variety of components. No complaints. Good sturdy quality as well. Looks awesome in the living room!	1
Setup was straight forward and I had everything working in about 20-30 minutes.  Then that night during the firmware update, the wireless network stopped working.  I  tried everything to get it working without success. I called Vizio support andn worked with them for over an hour and we could not get the wireless connection to work.  They sent our a repairman in about a week and a half and they changed a board in the TV.  When the repairman left the wireless network was working fine.  Again that night when the TV did the firmware upgrade, the wireless network stopped working.  After trying a bunch of different ways to resolve the problem, I determined that it would work on WEP network and on a plain WPA network connection but not on the more secure WPA-PSK encryption network I and running.  Vizio indicated that I would need to downgrade my network security to get the wireless network to function with the TV.  I'm not going to downgrade my network for a TV, so I returned the TV an purcahsed a LG 47LW5600 that works just fine on my existing network.	0
This puppet enchanted my grand daughter who wanted to operate it but alas it is too big for that. The mirror inside it's open mouth is rather distorting,and questionable if it was necessary. It did wash nicely and has provided entertaining moments with a one year old in the arm chair this winter.	0
Great for kids church class. Easy for little hands and they understand the story better having a visual. Highly recommend.	0
If you're looking for a gift for a child that's just the right combination of fun, excitement, and an excellent learning experience, you've found it.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this product enough. I bought it for my five year-old niece and it quickly became an adventure for her and the entire family.<br /><br />The caterpillars were delivered promptly. All five were alive and soon began eating themselves silly. The chrysalides formed in a matter of hours after just a couple days of eating. A few days later, they hatched overnight into gorgeous Pink Ladies.<br /><br />What a wonderful way to teach children (and adults!) about the miracle and fragility of life.<br /><br />The house itself is durable and well-made and the educational materials that accompany it are clear and informative.<br /><br />One tip if you do buy this item: Keep an eye on them. They grow up so fast! Taking pictures of their different stages might be good for a elementary school science project, too.	1
Does a great job but does not have a timer. This could be dangerous as I am likely to be distracted and forget to monitor the oven. Other than that though, good oven.	1
The leaves get stuck in these and they're not easy to get out..I mean they of course wash off but I mean to get the leaves into whatever you are adding them to, have to keep stopping and brushing them into the soup, etc.  Bigger pain in the but then just cutting up the leaves or using regular kitchen scissors.	0
Hopefully this will may help the few like me who havent played it if you want to start off with the first game of the series.  Buy it, it's cheap and worth 5 to 10 bucks.  I have always been a fan of nice sword play and this game has it.  I really liked all the controls on this game.  You have pretty good control of the camera and although it can get tricky, I liked it.  I can see how some would say that it gets repetitive in the game with the missions, but I stuck with it and I am glad I did.  The landscape is excellent and just seemed to get better and better as the game went on.  The fights and assassinations really improved toward the end.  I heard that the second game is better and I can't wait to play it.	0
The wrapping paper looks nice but there wasn't very much of it.  I could only wrap about 3 medium sized gifts and then ran out of paper!  I expected more for the price.	0

Bought these for our daughter who has ADHD.  We use it at night.  Seems to help her wind down and sleep better (sometimes an issue with the ADHD medication.)<br /><br />Not sure about the idea of using them during the day.  I would be afraid they would cause drowsiness.  But I like them for night time.	0
My only complaint was UPS leaving the package on my doorstep. Easy to set up and use. It would have been nice if it included cables.	0
Very solid pole mount. My only complaint is the locking mechanism for each tier of the mount can easily get frozen into place or overly tightened and can't be undone without a clamp of wrench of some sort that I have at my house and not in my pack.	1
The fabric is really thin and flimsy.  Also didn't like the fact that it doesn't include throw pillows if its in the picture.  But I did get it delivered with time to spare.	0
The doll house arrived in a huge box with tons of pieces. You will certainly need your patience with this one. The finish on the pieces isn't all that great, if you move it they tend to slip out of place, so once you get it together make sure it stays put.	1
We have this on one of our trees near the woods. It has creep-ed out my wife multiple times on her little backyard walk even thought she helped me pick a spot for it. We wont be doing the pump thing, it is just fine without it.	1
These far exceed my expectations they are well built packaged well and beautiful well worth the price.	0
wasn't everything that I was thinking it would be.  I had a hard time making it work for my application.  it was made out of good materials and arrived fast but it was not what I was after	1
I warned my friend as the reviewers here warn other customers. If you don't want your pets to die from poison, you should stay away from this.	1
I am still having some issues getting the watch to sync with the atomic signal but aside from that the watch is great.  It is much lighter and less bulky than my G-100 and the price is great compared to the GW-5000.  It has the same module as the GW-5000 but is about $180 less.  I had a DW-5000 but the case and band eventually dried out and fell apart.  The added features of Tough Solar and Multi Band 6 (atomic time) make this one a deal. 3/12/15 UPDATE: No problem allowing the watch to auto-sync overnight.  Just leave the watch in a window per the directions.  Does not seem to be able to complete a manual sync.	0
Really cool looking backpack as you can clearly see. It's really comfortable and it doesn't hurt my back like most of my other back packs used to. The backpack is all made of leather and it feels really nice to the touch. It's pretty to look at, it has enough space for everything I need to put in, and the straps feel nice on my shoulders.	1
First off, I upgraded from an Insignia 24&#34; LED 1080p seen here http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B005TNRM8Q This TV is trip to the moon difference better from the Insignia, Can't go wrong, I have it on the wall and the sound is great, I am not using it for my entertainment system, it's a dining room addition.  Colors are vibrant, blacks are what they need to be, black. Timer to set up the auto power on and off is great.  I had a good experience mounting it with this http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B000WYVBR0  Tried different angles and the viewing was good or excellent in almost all. Samsung for some reason have this idea to have a light in their T.V's front side when they are off. this one has a little red light that does not bother me at all. Other Samsung TV I have has a giant blue light that it is annoying if you have the T.V in the bedroom. why they add this lights is a mystery to me you know when the T.V is off and On, has image TV ON, Not image TV is OFF, as simple as that.  Some people also complain that this is not the thinnest T.V either well unless you are going to set it in a razor thin wall the difference between 3.5&#34; and 1.5&#34; in back space is meaningless. the deep unless you have serious space problems is useless the wide distance is in the back and you are looking at the screen from the front so who cares? I understand the difference with old TV's and the bulky back side. Having 3.5&#34; against 1.5&#34; for more $100? give me the cheaper 3.5&#34; and $100 back in my bank account.  Because i am not using any external sources of sound and care too much about that in the bedroom I did not care as much about the lack of outputs for headsets or even speakers like some people in these reviews seem to care so much but if you do it is something to consider. This is the best TV for the price TV for these usages:  1. Bedroom T.V / Kids room. 2. Kitchen T.V 3. To be used as a monitor if your computer HAS a HDMI connection 4. if you use your TV ata regular volume and don't care about external sources of sound.(Speakers, headsets, sound bars). 5. You have a cable box or signal source which native resolution is 720p if you pay the extra for the 1080p the T.V image wont be any better unless you watch blue rays in a blue Ray capable DVD (Timer Warner boxes for instance have a native resolution of 720p). 6. You don't want to break the Bank to have a good quality T.V mostly for regular T.V viewing. 7. Want a flat panel too replace that old bulky TV a flat panel that is it not as thin as a sheet of paper but thinner than old TV's you want to replacement (My case). 8. Don't mind that the ports are in the back (Again except for some TV's where the ports are on the side you usually get them in the back) Save $50 and get the http://www.amazon.vote/gp/product/B00SSFVSMS	1
This is a reliable screwdriver and I never had to struggle when unscrewing those tiny, annoying little screws. It came in particularly handy when there was a bout of gadget getting wet.	1
Product was as described and seller shipped promptly.  Watch isn't exactly as I expected but seller was great and honest.	0
Talk about an instant hit, when Harley our Old English Bulldog took one look at this ball it was love at first site - along with first bite. At 95 pounds Harley makes mince meat out of most dog toys in a matter of seconds so we tend to rely on toys made specifically for aggressive chewers such those by Nylabone, Kong, Orbee and a few others.<br /><br />Our younger Bull Dog Elvis is more "stick crazy" but Harley has been a natural born soccer player going on eight years. What's especially nice about this ball is due to the deep indentation around the circumference he has no problem carrying it round.<br /><br />Since we took it out of the box a week ago - just like an American express card he rarely leaves home without it!<br /><br />He carries it out side an schleps it back in the house covered with mud which is wonderful when you have white carpet.<br /><br />He snoozes next to it and insists I throw out my back heaving him onto the bed with his beloved Chuck it! clenched in his teeth like a big fat orange stogie.<br /><br />Simply put - he adores it.<br /><br />Surprisingly the ball has held up beautifully. Usually most of the toys we buy for these guys end up looking like road kill in a matter of days. I had some concern over the material not holding up but this is one well made dog toy.<br /><br />It's survived merciless games of tug-O-war between the two dogs and although there are puncture marks neither has been able to rip the ball apart.<br /><br />* Great Design Is Easy For Dogs To Carry<br /><br />* Made Like Iron - Holds Up To Aggressive Chewers<br /><br />* Great Bounce<br /><br />* Solid Rubber Core<br /><br />* Terrific Distance When Kicked<br /><br />* Provides Sensational Exercise<br /><br />* Top Quality Materials<br /><br />* Well Made And Made To Last.<br /><br />In fact I just ordered another one of these and one of the Chuck It! Tug-O-War balls . Simply a sensational, well made dog toy. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />5 Paws Up!	0
This backpack is really nice!  Its super padded so i can put my tablet and ipad in it..  it has so many pockets and compartments for just about anything you want to carry..  the material is made to last, very strong!  It has a whistle on it ( i thought was really neat ) its perfect for camping or spending the day fishing! Or everyday use...  its very comfortable to wear....: )	1
I think all Leap Frog products are just great for children.  Safe and well designed and very intuitive for children.	0
They worked, and they didn't damage my bike. They do put a lot of strain on the handlebars though. I could see handlebars flex. Next trip I will use additional straps to secure the front end and tighten down less on these.	0
The only thing I don't like about this heater--is that my parents did not have it when we camped long ago! This quickly heats up the tent, is easy to use, and simple to transport. We have two, one for the adult tent, one for the kids' tent. We don;t go camping without it.	1
i love this home theater,it has an amazing sounds which you can choose your favorite from the system,all i can say the system is worth the price.	1
I have only had this light for a couple of weeks but so far I think this is an excellent light. It seems well made and I have not experienced any problems. I would recommend this light and would buy another one if needed.	1
I love all the wonderful and great features of this TV.<br /><br />One of the most amazing part is that you can access the Google Play Store to download any of your favourite applications. I need download a lot applications in my life, and this TV system helps me a lot.<br /><br />Another amazing part is that it has 3 USD ports, which is good enough for me to connect with my mouse, keyboard and my webcam.<br /><br />Great product!	1
the concept is great.  This is the only fitness bracelet I've seen with this capability. It is well built, fits well, and I believe if the app actually worked it would be a great device. I've had my device since 12/21. The android app wasn't available until 12/24 and it took forever for the bracelet to link to the app. Once that was accopmplished half of the options were unavailable, not working at all, or their functionality wasn't clear. Yes, the website has some brief &#34;how to&#34; instructions, but nothing to assit with the alarm issues or MOST IMPORTANTLY the sync issues. My biggest pet peeve is there is no help desk, no one to contact, no customer support of any kind. You can leave a FB message, but that is useless all you get is others complaining of the same issues you're experiencing.<br /><br />I'm a Seattle girl and I want to support local businesses, but I'm afraid I'm not going to continue my support where the Pivotal Tracker is concerned. I understand wanting to meet the holiday rush and get your product out there, but with poor customer service and a product that is not ready they've set themselves up for an epic failure. If the glitches aren't fixed by the new year I'm returning my bracelet.	0
There are only a few games I've ever bothered to review and that was on GameFaqs not Amazon. For ME3, I really do feel the need to review the game.  I will state that I have played the series from part 1 all the way to now. I played ME1 three times, ME2 six times because I enjoyed the story, the characters and the lore quite a bit.  ME3, well that's a different story all together.<br /><br />Visually I thought the game looked nice, though it is pretty obvious that the game visually has high and low points during certain scenes and parts of the story.  My Shepard looked slightly older and tired (which would makes sense from a story perspective) in some scenes and then look fairly young in others so consistency wasn't there. That isn't a make or breaks though just an observation.<br /><br />Gameplay wise I thought the combat felt a bit loser, but that's mainly because Shepard has more freedom of control in his/her movements, it didn't feel as cumbersome as ME1 but strangely felt a bit more lose than ME2. They definitely made the game even more TPS (3rd person shooter) than the previous two titles, but I overall enjoyed that aspect.<br /><br />They cut down on the character roster, but I originally thought that was due to the quality vs. quantity approach. While I'd say there were some pretty memorable dialog and interaction, the amount vs. the previous two titles is lower. Day 1 DLC controversy didn't affect me to much since I purchased the collector's edition but I can understand why people are upset about this because Jarvik really had some interesting insight into the lore and he definitely contributed more to the actual storyline vs. say the DLC characters in ME2 so to make him a DLC, I just don't agree with that.<br /><br />Voice acting I thought was great as always, so no real surprises here.<br /><br />The story is where all the trouble really is for everyone.  I really don't want to get into any more details about this because it has been talked to death already. For me the ending was like Bioware sucker punched me in the stomach and then took my wallet, laughed and then walked off. It really left me with a feeling of disgust as to how someone at Bioware thought this was the appropriate way to finish the Mass Effect series. Leaving lose ends in the 2nd part of a trilogy or 1st part is understandable but a finale is supposed to tie those all up, not create brand new plot holes that are so huge you could fly the entire Sword fleet through it! The ending basically negates everything you were doing in ME1 and ME2.  I originally planned on replaying the whole game over again to do different decisions and see how those decisions would affect the final outcome. I no longer feel this; I just want to forget about the whole game. It is because of this that I feel this game deserves this rating.<br /><br />It really does sadden me that this is how Bioware decided to conclude Shepard's story.  And before anyone says it's the journey not the final destination, I think the survivors of the Titanic might have something to say to that. While it is true the journey can have a very strong impression on a person, the ending can make or break things.  In this case, the ending did break it. If Bioware's ultimate goal was to get "speculation from everyone" and get an ending no one would forget, mission accomplished but to bad was for all the wrong reasons.	0
I have been using this whenever I'm on a travel or when I need to have an overnight with friends. I'm happy to have it because I can simply organize my personal things like toothbrush, powder, sanitizer, paste, and ect inside. My friends asked me about this and planning their planning to buy for them.	1
I wish these were a little more durable. I got it caught on a bolt crossing the bunk feeding calves. Ripped a big hole no problem on the of the color part of the boot.  I broke these boots in barefooted they rock I love them. Got another pair for good. They need to make these in purple😊	0
Great shoe for the $$ ...a bit stiff until broken in.  Overall comfortable shoe.  The size E is more like the normal	0
I got it in plenty of time for Halloween this year, I kept it a surprise from my family. We had a cult-de-sac party this year so I figured I'd surprise everyone. It worked, great reactions from all. It fit just well as it fills with air if you are shorter, my son who is taller than I also wore it and it fit him well also.    The only issue I had was one of the gloves came un-sewn . We fixed it, so it wasn't a big deal, I would give this a costume 5 stars had it not had a defect.	0
The pump works very well for transferring fuel from a portable gas can. I found it to be super handy, easy to use and reliable. It also pumps fairly quickly for a portable battery operated pump. Just a great product.	1
This is a great addition to my camping gear. The plastic is very thick so it does not tear that easily.	1
Works well but a little flimsy! I like the suction cups in the middle, you stick the suction cup on the window then stick the shade on or take it off as needed without taking the suction cup off. Pretty convenient!	0
For its time, this was probably quite a shocker and explored some territory that we were not used to seeing in film:  lesbians in a relationship and in the world of sports.<br /><br />The two weak points for me were Hemingway, who was not such a great actress; and the fact that the movie seemed to drag on much longer than it needed to.  Otherwise, it is nicely shot and has a good core story.	0
These boots are great for snow, but they are a bit clunky for some everyday activities such as grocery shopping. They're definitely heavy duty and well made. Overall I'm very happy that I purchased these boots, I know I'll be able to wear them for years. As for the sizing, I bought my normal size (8) and they fit great!	0
It takes round about 5 mins from opening the box to get it up and<br /> running with pictures. After I was done with the pairing I just<br /> quickly uploaded my wedding album and dragged it to a playlist I had<br /> assigned to this frame. Pictures start appearing almost instantly.<br /> It seemed a bit expensive but when I saw the quality of the pictures<br /> being shown I was very happy with my decision. Getting a few this<br /> Christmas.	1
I brought it for company meetings.very stable and useful.Unique design,recommend this product.I am going to buy one for my home.	1
I have used Krazy Adhesive for years. Many trapped fingertips and white-colored glue spots on many equipment. However, this Highest possible Connection Click Lid Edition set a lot of problems. First off the Attach snap secure protect keeps it clean and prepared for a no hassle next use. (Remember to clean to tip before closing) No more run out pipes, or reducing for a new beginning. Just clean the tip before you screw it. Really like It!!!	1
These are great and have a perfect fit.  I had to replace 2 for my spa and they lasted well over 4years.	0
This is so adorable RC. Haha. It is small in size but has the same quality and durability of the big rc hercules. Me and my younger love playing these toys. We even bump each other RC on the mid air and still our RC is fine and functioning.	1
A simple, well-made, showerhead at a good price, for those who don't need 8 or more settings. It does the job and does it well. I thought, this shower head would be a rugged functional choice.	1
Its a good cleaner but I rather have it in a squirt bottle.<br /><br />A tip: Instead of wasting paper towers try using newspaper. Cleans your glass really well!	1
This is one of the books used in our language class at Norther Michigan University. An invaluable guide to the language. We are attempting to reignite the language (that has been mostly lost to the Anishinaabe in our area) here where it originated. This book is an amazing help. Thank you.	0
Effective product.  When I first get it I put it at one end of a large attic room and then a couple days later at the other end.  To dispose, I'm going to toss it into the crawl space and let it dissipate over time.  Fewer insects there mean fewer spiders if I need to go down in there.  And if it dissipates out where it's useful then it is not a disposal issue.  I can just leave it there.  Ditto for the insulation attic.	0
Scot Spooner should keep writing! His words are inspiring. "Your Life" is a good reminder to take responsibility for your actions, make good decisions and stay focused on you and yours. Life is what YOU make it. A quick read - pick it up!	0
Need for an upgrade to a laptop computer. Opened it up and installed it in 2 minutes. Remove the battery and unplug it first. Also hold down on the power button for a few seconds before installing the memory. Put the cover back on and rebooted. After recognizing the upgrade it booted ad worked much better.	0
This is an attractive stainless steel safety razor stand.  It fits my double edge razors nicely.  My Gillette Profusion does not fit unless your turn it sideways to insert into the prongs. Once in, and jiggle around a little it can then be straightened.  I don't consider this a negative because it was designed for double edge razors, not cartridge ones, but just wanted to point this out.<br /><br />Like<br />* The Stainless steel finish was very nice.  No flaws noticed.<br />* Although it's a simple design, It's attractive and looks good sink-side.<br /><br />Dislikes<br />* The base is only about 2 ½" in diameter.  When loaded with a couple of razors, it's not as stable as I'd like.  It does not fall over, but if bumped a little it can.  I wish the base was wider.<br />* At is arrived the top nut would not screw down enough to hold the prongs securely.  They would spin like a pinwheel.  I had to take it apart, reverse to order of the prongs, the re-tightened it.  Even with this fix, the prongs can be easily rotated.  I think I'll need to get a rubber or stainless steel washer to adequately fix it.<br /><br />I will comment on durability after I've had it for a while.  Overall it is decent product.  However, a wider base and better design on the top nut would make it much better one.	0
We have been using these for the last several years. They are easy to keep clean and easy to maintain.	0
Worked perfectly to adapt the front/rear channels of my OEM heat unit to 4 channels of full range amplification. I ran 17 ft of twisted shielded pair cable to the rear of my truck, through this converter, to rear mounted amps for all channels and back up to the receiver location for integration into the OEM speaker wire harness. I cannot detect any noise in the system above what the OEM receiver already produced. The system sounds great and I couldn't be more pleased with this unit for making it all work.	0
I don't know how good this winder will be after this, but for now, it is working great. I'll probably update this review after the product breaks down or something. If not, then the review stays as is.	1
This arrow has major battery issues.  The standard L626 battery will die after 1 minute of continuous use.  I have other bore sighters and they have no issues, and the batteries last for years.  Other than the battery, the arrow is fine.	0
nice finish but I was shocked at it coming with a  cheap crappy top cap when it was described as alloy top cap in former adds!!  Check out also the adds for their Pro series risers which now come I here in plastic!!  Plastic top caps are a no go!!  Guaranteed to brake and  disintigrate later and you will have to add a longer bolt and aluminum cap at extra cost?  Might as well get a Orin8, Krex. or  Dimension Riser as they are all well made with solid alloy caps!!.	0
I bought the Hershey's with nuts for my husband and he loves them, I sneak a candy from his box when he's not looking there really good. I guess I'll have to buy them more often.	0
I took this bag on a cruise, and it kept my toiletries organized. It didn't come with the ring to hang it though.	0
This was a good DVD player for us.  Took a lot of abuse until the fateful day we knocked it off the bar and the thing never turned back on since then.  It had a good battery life when it was fully charged, and it came with a car charger which was awesome.  However, the thing couldn't charge and play at the same time.  Just not enough juice coming in to do both.  The screen isn't as bright and clear as other players, but it is a pretty good player.<br /><br />I ding this player a star for the both the charger issue and screen clarity.  Not show stoppers, mind you, but both of them combined I think is worth a star.	0
I can't think of anything more fun as a young boy than driving around in a Jeep of my own and if my nephews' reaction to the Fisher-Price Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler is any indication, they agree. They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with!<br /><br />The 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve.<br /><br />The 6-year-old is a tall 49&#34; but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride.<br /><br />The charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else.<br /><br />There's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included.<br /><br />The Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up. No complaints yet though!<br /><br />After about 3 weeks of daily riding it is still in great shape! With 3 boys that is a huge positive in my book and kind of surprising. It's very sturdy and well made.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this Jeep to anyone with kids. They will love it!	0
This item is OK.  However, there is no way to adjust the fit at the bottom to ensure a tight fit.  The elastic, with a hook on the end, was all ready very loose when the product arrived so I don't suppose it will hold up long without some sort of adjusting and/or replacing on our part.  The cover in the back has elastic in it but it arrived stretched out so there was no way to tighten it to make it fit properly.  My husband somehow made it work with bungee cords, which should not have had to take place.  It was just easier to &#34;try&#34;  to make it work then to return it.  So, we have no idea how long this product will last, but will use it as long as we can.  It is unlikely we would order this particular product again.	0
Well made, easy to install, looks great!  Soft surface doesn't get too hot in harsh sun.  Installs with a elastic band	0
I was astounded, and more than disappointed that National Geo could come up with no more a plot than this reality show.I only watched 1 episode, it was so boring I was heartbroken I spent all that money.. the documentary  on Instant Amazon about the Hutterites is what you are looking for.IT is AWESOME!!!!! I rented it and watched it several times, and brought in guests to see it with me. In a word, this stinks, but the other one on Amazon Instant is  good as it gets!!!!!!! if anyone knows of more programs about them, let me know, by commenting..	0
Great photos and thought provoking for a home cook. But honestly it is a bit overwhelming for me. I am an avid home cook but these recipes require new equipment, new methods and considerable effort or at least that is my impression. As of now I have only made some of the pestos. In time I intend to do more but I will take it slow.	0
The only reason I can't rate it a 5 star is because I have not crash tested it. This is my first helmet and it is very confortable and styling. It adjusts well to fit your size and head shape	1
This is very well made, the color is however darker than the picture and I think it's kinda ugly, but I'm a girly kind of chick so I'd prefer it to be black or something besides this green color. I'd even be happy with red.<br /><br />The stitching is thick and the canvas material I'm assuming, has a fairly big play in protecting. This fit my Sony with no problems. It has room for my iPad, but I haven't used the bag for that.<br /><br />There are plenty of compartments for someone who likes to be organized. The bonus is the warranty, my laptop won't even make it that long.<br /><br />This is a solid product!	0
This money clip is exactly what I was looking for. It is small enough to keep in my front pocket with no obvious bulge, yet holds what I need for an average day.    Good product-I would purchase again.	1
What I got was a very well made bag that looks GREAT (seriously, I get so many compliments).<br /><br />PROS:<br />- VERY sturdy - all the hardware is good-quality and has held up beautifully<br /><br />- Great quality (the leather,the fabric & stitching )<br />- Clasp buttons located underneath straps make for easy to snap the straps on/off<br />- Straps on the front are easily adjustable<br />- Stylish looking<br />- Right size (fits everything I need it to for several days at a time, including toiletries, 2-3 outfits, my MacBook Pro, power cords, jewelry, and other items, such as a spare pair of shoes).<br />- The fabric is highly adjustable, so you can cram this backpack full and have it carry everything, or pack it lightly and pull the cables tight so the backpack looks smaller when wearing it<br />- Zip up pocket on the back is easily accessible when wearing this bag for items you want to access without taking your backpack off (ex: your subway card)<br />- Good price	1
This is a pretty lame product to be honest. It's just too hard to use and I'm confused as to what it's actually meant to be.	1
This product does exactly what it advertises it does. If you're looking for a model with wifi, then obviously don't buy this one. Some people seem to have missed that!	0
I received my razor in about a week  The razor is somewhat small for large hands but it does a good job.  ..kinda nostalgic. I will definitely order a butterfly double edge for Christmas presents.	0
I was sent this and [[ASIN:B00VUHJUDK another solar powered outdoor light]] and neither one managed to last longer than three days. It was a bit tricky to get this set up, but I managed to get it situated near my front door and the first evening I was amazed by it--both the motion sensor and the *sound* sensor actually worked. Loved that I could walk up to my front door, rattle my keys near it and it would just turn on. I believe that had to be the coolest feature I'd ever seen on a light. However, it was shortlived because it stopped working properly on the second night. (The other died on the third night.)<br /><br />I first noticed that the sound detection wasn't working properly, although the motion detection was. I didn't think much of it because I could live with it even without the sound detection. By the end of the week, the light stopped working entirely. To make sure it wasn't just in a bad location, I cleaned the solar panel and deliberately put it out in the sunniest location on my property I could find, and since I'm in Florida, we have no shortage of sunlight. Still, no love.<br /><br />It was great while it lasted, unfortunately it just didn't last very long.	1
Friend of mine bought a couple of 2014 historic Les Paul's.  Gibson for the first time have made a killer scatter wound PAF with alnico 2 and 3 magnets.  Loved the sound so much I looked to SD to get a similar tone.  Wow, even better than I was hoping for. Rich midrange, sweet highs and full bottom end. Highly recommended.	0
This is a terrific TV! It's the right size for my small home office, but still big enough to see it from across the room. Color is very sharp, and even the sound, which typically isn't great on these TVs, isn't bad. It has several different modes for both picture and sound, so you can change things around until you have what you want. On occasion, things I've taped don't go full screen, which is weird, but it doesn't take away from the experience. And the price is phenomenal! We bought two.	0
A great camera case for a great price. I am really happy with it. It is compact yet efficient and I would not need anything else than this case.	1
I have worn reeboks in all different styles and the same 91/2 size for years. but these shoes were cut much more narrow across the toe area and I had to return them. I compared them to other reeboks I own and it was obvious that the toe box area is more narrow in this style. Also, the description does state &#34;creating micro-instability with every step&#34; which is true - I point this out because if you have issues with knees or ankles this might not be the shoe for you  (although it worked for me). I wanted badly to keep the shoe because of the ankle support and the thick sole - but I just could not handle the small toe box. I love reeboks and will be shopping for others. BTW, the synthetic blue accents  seemed like cheap plastic and was a weird shade of blue making it look gaudy more than sporty.	0
amazing gun, pump and fire again pump and fire, looks real and durable much power full shorts.and heavy in weight i must recommend this to you. thanks	1
I love my Sony Digital Camera. I chose Sony brand because i have had many Sony products and have been pleased with them. I highly recommend this camera since they gave speedy delivery to my house and that too pleased me!	1
Despite the shortcoming of the USPS the seller was very cooperative . The box works fine and we are happy!	0
CRKT makes okay knives,they come sharp and function and that's all some people are after but as far as the Lake Signature? definitely their finest knife(in my opinion).In short this knife is one of those models to seek out among the pile of modern knives,made in 2001/2002.So let's get to the knife...<br /><br />Aluminum/Zytel Construction:<br />Altogether I'm not a stickler for weight on a modern knife,especially if it's made with metallic alloys but some people are.For a aluminum bodied knife it's got the most heft versus something like a Gerber AR 3.0 or the Gerber Air Ranger,I actually like that reminds me how solid this knife is.The zytel inlay is just for texture because hand perspiration makes a metal alloyed knife slippery,can't say much for it other than it helps and it hasn't came out.There is a half-length zytel backspacer to substitute the typical two pillar construction,I believe over the years they have changed to pillar design but Michael Walker designs used to possess this backspacer approach.<br /><br />Blade Access/LAWKS Design:<br />Like your common Taiwan made knife the washers are Teflon,personally I think they're as good as bronze...smooth opening.The actual blade access is very unusual because thumb-studs aren't used and this design won't replace them,but it's a cool and effective approach by CRKT.The Design is a milled out nail-nick with machining work above it at the blade spine,I guess they went with the handle shape thumb studs weren't possible with the design.Some people ask the question 'why bother make a liner lock with a safety switch'?a very good question.Liner locks vary a lot in reliability,mostly if they are thick or thin, or if their perfectly centered under the blade.With a traditional liner lock a big no no is punching holes with it using force,maybe not the first time you do it will the lock fail and it will happen eventually.The LAWKS design is a steel secondary washer beside the blade with a tab and when you activate it that tab leans forward and goes behind the liner lock while deployed.Now I wouldn't praise the LAWKS design by Michael Walker so highly to say it will replace lockbacks and fixed blades on a permanent basis,but it will blow away the common liner lock as it's intended for hard use.On the Lake Signature you slide the pocket clip to angled position to engage the LAWKS system,slide the clip to straight position to disengage.The function isn't like turning a bolt it's a smooth click action.The pocket clip design of this secondary lock CRKT went for a more stealthy/tactical approach,they pulled it off nicely and I haven't damaged my pocket clip but I'd rather it be the common Walker design,a push/pull lever.<br /><br />Clip-Point Blade/AUS-8 Japanese Stainless Steel:<br />It's a good looking clip-point,came very sharp with a attractive satin finish and well designed serrations,not Spyderco or original Lone Wolf quality but I'd rate them a 7.5 out of 10.The blade has 3-1/4" cutting edge with some swedgework and a hollow grind,makes a good small game knife.The AUS-8 I've got to give props to Taiwan for using on their knives,japanese steels are well designed for an actual knife user and for some reason I've seen better performance on knives overseas than I have on American made knives.Not much I can dive into about AUS-8 other that it holds a pretty good edge yet it's just soft enough to sharpen on a stone,pretty low maintenance steel since it's smooth sharpening.These days AUS-8 is more common to come across but ten to twelve years ago? it made 440A look like garbage.Aside from this steel there were some really good japanese steels out there like ATS-34 and ATS-55,those are pretty rare on knives as VG-10 replaced them currently but they were premium steels.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br />Overall the fit and finish was excellent and I really liked the knife and I highly recommend the 7113 Lake Signature model by CRKT.This is the only knife I ever bought by CRKT,not all their knives are junk but there's a few reasons why this knife costs more than a typical CRKT knife...<br /><br />-It's a rare knife by CRKT,discontinued about ten years ago<br /><br />-It was a fourty dollar knife as a more premium/high quality offering by CRKT.It's a little outdated looking versus their newer knives but it's still a great knife!<br /><br />5-stars!	0
I ordered this soap saver along with the Spectrum 50550 soap saver, this one is SO much better. It works perfect in the shower or on the sink. I am very pleased with this product.	0
Ordered for my wife who's a jewelry enthusiast and she loved it. It works perfectly well just as a long nose pliers should. I also use it sometimes when I have to fix something in my bicycle.	1
According to my granddaughter, it works perfect!  It was a great Christmas gift and the right price too.  Good purchase.	0
Sturdy, well made. Was a little bit of a pain to put together. I plan on putting together a rudamentory cleaning kit to put in the water tight container.	0
The thing which I did not like, is that as a women's backpack it is a little smaller than what I'm used to from regular backpacks. The shoulder straps are nicely cushioned, though.	1
I wrote some reviews of this in beige and I just wanted to say the black is just as beautiful and comfortable. I did forget to mention that is washes beautifully and after several washing's it still looks like new.	1
Great if you're trying to use soundboards or if your headset just won't work! I recommend it to any xbox user.	0
I bought this for my niece and she thanked me for it. Physically, I think it's very sturdy and well-made. As for the use, I'm not really sure but the covers my niece has been recording has improved, I must say!	1
this is a cute pendulum, but it does not come with any instructions on how to use it so I still need to figure that out.	0
The cabinetry is very nice, although the inside trays are made of rather flimsy plastic. If you plan to hang it on a door, make sure it won't hit a wall when the door is open. Also if you are hanging on a door, you will likely need to put foamy tape on the cabinet so it doesn't bang around when opened.	1
Great. The best one in the market. Looks amazing and works perfectly. Do not search anymore. This is the one.	0
It can keep my kids (6&8) busy for hours. The youngest one tends to distract easily but this game helps them focus while looking for the items. I try to play often to create a habit.	0
This is essential for isolated houses.  We have a cabin and we go there for getaways about 6 times a year.  It''s not always convenient but it's a great reminder of what we should be grateful for.  Water filter is definitely essential.  We have an electric purifier but as a backup, this lifestraw filter is great.	1
In this price the pump is like free to me as the orignal is 53 $ + tax it fits well and works fine it looks same as the orignal the clips the pipes all fits as the orignal fits  and it works good so far but i dont no how much time it will go on runing if it will survive  1 year  nothing like it yes i do recommend every one to buy this dont need to spend many dollars on orignal its not the mechenical part so u camn take risk buying after market	1
Nice quality, seems very durable. Great & funny decal. This say's it all ! I don't see any problems . will buy again.	1
Why all the bags looking the same??? there are free knight which domain the market, why they keep pooping out same design different brand any where?	1
I love love love this case. I would buy this case in all the colors it's offered in if I could afford too. This case is solid and well constructed.  Kudos on a job well done.	0
One of my favorite product!!! I really enjoy this Vitamin C Serum for face, highest quality Vitamin C Serum, best for Skin and facial care, absolutely 100% satisfied.	1
Ce casque d'écoute sans fil est si léger. Le fait qu'il est petit le rend très utile pour le prendre sur la route. Je l'utilise beaucoup avec mon iPod et MP3 à la salle de gym. La batterie intégrée rechargeable est un vrai plus et elle dure plus longtemps que celle de mon dernier casque. Le microphone semble cool, je ne l'ai pas encore essayé. Pour moi, c'est toujours le son qui compte et ces casques paraissent impressionnants!	1
This trainer helps drill ball players mainly in hand/eye coordination. It does not replicate pitching like a pitching machine but it does a fair job of reproducing soft toss with several variations built in. Overall this is bigger than it looks in the picture. The tubes have a disconcerting way of coming loose now and then, and the height adjustment knob should not be made of this kind of flimsy plastic, but otherwise it works as advertised. The dispensing of the ball onto the rebound net offers some element of unpredictability as the ball does not always bounce up to the same extent and direction. I suppose that is good. It is hard to draw a correlation from a scientific viewpoint but my kid has been using this for two weeks and the last few games have been a bit more productive for him after being on the machine. He has hit some pretty good line drives lately. I would like to think it is extra practice afforded by this machine, but the verdict is still out. All in all, a usable product.	0
My use case was far less strenuous than that of the other reviewer.  I turned the solder pot on, added most of a pound of solder, and tinned some 4ga wires.  The solder pot did its job and melted the solder faster than I expected (perhaps 5 minutes to full heat, then 3 minutes to fully melt each .2 lb of solder).	0
Definitely a very convenient tool to have in the car, the home, and in the office. It's very easy to use, just the right length, and when they advertised it as an all-in-one tool, that's exactly what it was.	1
These were an impulse purchase and I am so happy I listened to some of the other great reviews!  They are nice quality especially for the low price, and look beautiful on.  They're just the right small size for everyday and I find that they're ideal when I am wearing an attention-getting necklace or bracelet as they don't steal the spotlight at all.  I haven't had any problems at all with the backs falling off of mine, and they feel secure - so it seems possible that this has been improved since previous reviews were written.  I am very pleased with these earrings and would definitely repeat this purchase.	0
It's a BBQ tong and does what a BBQ tong does. I suppose that's a compliment these days where a lot of tongs don't do what tongs are supposed to do.	1
I like it as a casual watch, clear face, easy to read, indeglo is great at night and I like the leather band instead of an expansion band. good all around watch	0
Just what we needed is another high school reunion romantic comedy featuring mostly impossibly good looking former classmates, all with some hang-ups or dragged baggage.  The cast is fine and each pairing has a story.<br /><br />Channing Tatum is Jake and his real life wife, Jenna Dewan-Tatum is his girlfriend Jess.  He's been working up to popping the big marriage question but puts it off until after the reunion.  Once there he finds his old high school sweetheart, Mary (Rosario Dawson) along with her new husband (Ron Livingston) in tow.  Then we have drunken party boy Cully (Chris Pratt) and his disapproving wife (Ari Graynor).  Also Lynn Collins as the former high school party girl, still trying to live up to that image, but with a secret.  Best friends played by Justin Long and Max Minghella are living on a fantasy reputation and seek to get in Anna's (Collins) pants.  One of the more interesting pairings is Oscar Isaac as Reeves who has become a famous pop star whose long ago crush on Elise (Kate Mara) has been reignited.<br /><br />If this all sounds all too formulaic, well it is.  On the other hand the performances are solid enough and there are enough chuckles and bubbling emotions to keep the audience interested for 90 minutes.  Watchable but also forgettable.	0
Nothing special, a nice spin ring. Came very quickly and has lasted nearly a year now, no skin discoloration or anything.	0
These belts are being used to sharpen leather working tools.  They quickly put a very fine edge on our tools.  However it requires a very light touch or a variable speed belt sander.	0
My son Loves it<br />I was looking for a stroller for my 2.5 year old boy, because he started making me crazy that he wants to move around his plush animals in a stroller like my 4 YR old daughter. I didn't believe that I would ever find a blue doll stroller, until I looked on Amazon.com and found this stroller. I loved it so much that I bought it in blue and pink.<br />Let me share some of the pros and cons of this product; the quality is decent for the price you pay-it is not going to last for years,but it will last for about 6  months to 1 year. But on the other hand it's not expensive, the fabric is really strong and nice,  and the swiveling wheels is a plus. Any time the stroller is in my way, I just fold it up and it packs small for easy storage. I also like that the seat belt is not a buckle - it is just 1 piece to slide the doll in & out.<br /><br />Over all this is a very decent stroller for this price.	1
Got this in black and I like it. I use it for change and some loose bills when going to the market. The clasp clasps really well and the quality is great. It holds up pretty well and is spacy. I can even put in my earphones inside without it getting bulgy.	1
They are flimsy, crack, break, and the lid doesn't screw on tight enough, so they leak. I tossed them out and started using baggies to store my milk.	0
furnished well and the quality is magnificent.Strings are well aligned and sound quality is even more great. A great buy for me and would recommend these.	1
Great Tasting Stevia with no bitterness and no aftertaste. If you taste it directly, it is not very pleasant, however when added to beverages or anything else it tastes amazing! Highly recommended!!! Best Stevia Powder on the market!	1
Ya never know when your gonna need it so its good to have it there. It is durable and folds easy. Has a good look.	1
This thing makes veggies into some real cool shapes. We really enjoy it because there are a lot of hard to peel veggies in our fridge and they are a pain. Not with this tool anymore.	1
I've been using these a while now and it has adjusted along with my baby's size quite well. I give that props to the adjustable snaps.	1
This watch is very affordable and is doing its job perfectly.<br /><br />I needed to have an inexpensive watch to take with me on my travels and therefore bought this watch. Doing exactly what I was looking for. Nothing special, but exactly what you can expect in this price range.	1
I bought this product for a friend because she lived in a bad neighborhood within the city and I wanted to protect her as much as I could but being far away, this was my only option. So far she has been saved one time at night with a robbery. As soon as I heard this I realized I made the perfect choose to get this for her. I don't know how I could repay PiSector. Thanks!	1
Perfect sized for prepping my daughter's meals. The lids are very secure. I found them easy to put on, although you have to push it just right.	0
The Cayenne Hair Growth oil is pretty awesome. Since last year I started losing hair to the point of seeing a lot of my scalp. I tried many products and had doubts that anything will work for me, but boy was I wrong! I can see the difference. I used this oil for 10 weeks and it stopped my hair loss, I see my hair back to normal. I could tell that it was continuing to help my hair grow stronger and I notice more hair on my hair line. What's also cool about this product is that it helps moisturize my dry scalp! I totally recommend buying this!	1
I've charged my kindle fire HD, my phone (samsung galaxy s 3) and my PS3 controller and the bar still has a charge.  Great product, I'm thinking about getting a second!	0
worth every penny I spend on it, great Image, color and brightness, easy to set up jut plug it, turn it on and enjoy it.	0
This house is perfect for our little pomeranian mix. He just likes having a roof on his head and loves to nap there. There is soft padding for the inside and it's really easy to put together. the pattern on is really cute and it came with a little plush toy for the dog! overall very satisfied !	1
Suctions cups do not last, and keeps falling off. View is ok, if your child is facing you, but if under 2yrs, and the seat is facing back you can't see too much. Any bumps in the road move the mirror or knock it off the window.	0
These cashews are terrific.  We like non-gmo raw organic eats and the cashews were everything we expected!  I am ready to re-order!	0
My dog "Mister Puffy" is fouteen years old and weights ten pounds. He likes the taste of this product, and I mix it with his food. He has more energy and he seem to walk much better. We like Hi-Vite Drops and will continue using.	0
The best thing I can say is this is relatively inexpensive.  My problem is moisture, not particulates - actual water droplets coming through the system.  Its been a losing battle to getting these out of my air, and this did not fix that problem. I live in western Washington state and the humidity here is very high, I have an &#34;array&#34; of two air filters (counting this) and just added a third filter with an additional desiccant water removal stage. That seems to have done the trick, no more water droplets in my automotive paint. The desiccant is at the end of the filters and the little beads don't last very long, so there is still a lot of moisture coming through the water separators/filters. The compressor, by the way has an automatic drain on it and is 50' away from the regulator, so I think I've done everything there I can on that end. I am open to suggestions.  And this comes with no mounting bracket or way to mount and support it.  I have this on the inlet end of things, so that means the air hose is supported by the pipe nipple coming off the outlet with this filter hanging in between.	0
The advantage of this projector at this price point is its lens shift. Nothing beats this functionality over other competitor at this value.<br /><br />For picture quality, I am still getting adjusted to it since I used to have DLP projector so the color of this projector is quite dry me.	0
What a fantastic book on hitting by one of the greates all-time hitters, Ted Williams. In a nutshell, its a book designed to teach the reader to hit better by showing them a comprehensive look at the science behind hitting. A few things that seemed to stand out:<br /><br />-the style of writing is like he's standing there talking to you which makes for an easy read<br />-the batting advice is pretty thorough leaving no stone unturned<br />-the battting advice is based on science<br />-the pictures demonstrating the techniqes are OUTSTANDING and include all angles including some very good overhead shots<br />-the stories he tells of other baseball players are priceless!<br /><br />Highly recommended for anyone who wants to hit a ball better, I found it to be a very well-rounded book based on both science AND experience. Also recommend [[ASIN:1457527243 Bulletproof Your Shoulder]] if you have a shoulder problem that interferes with your playing.	1
Puppy didn't like this toy that much, He got bored of it. It is kinda hard for him to grab or play with. Might be good for larger dog. Not so good for smaller dog. The type of dog i have is a Shih Tzu.	1
I really like this watch.  It had EZ links in it which made it much simpler to remove links to make it smaller.  I could have used a couple of more EZ links as I have a tiny wrist, but I like it anyway.	0
This thing went on easy. It's perfect for an iphone 6 plus with a case. I'm completely satisfied. The glass has smooth edges so it's still very nice to use with touch Id gone button. Covers all the flat surface of the screen as well. Love it.	1
I have been taking honey from when i was a child and always love them till now,I ordered YS organic bee honey which i use every morning.so sweet!	1
Great way to count burned calories, I use it with my Ipod since I dont want t bring my iphone when doing runs. The price is just a little steep though considering its disposable.	1
Nice bag and excellent value.  Still got the &#34;new&#34; look but hoping that the patina will develop with use.  Practical layout.	0
I really like this watch. Watch is very lightweight and the band looks very handsome. Has everything you really need, two time zones, timer, stopwatch, daily alarm.	1
I took a chance on this bag and it was worth the risk! I am giving this 4 stars because the top stripe is uneven side to side. It does not bother me, and is not that noticeable from a pace away. I do want to give a heads up. I do not to warn you away but I do want to highlight that it is handmade from scraps that may not be even. The bag I received has a single top stripe like the bags pictured, but it has a series of vertical stripes (in different colors) instead of the second solid stripe. The back is a dusty lavender, the top stripe is brown, and the sides are natural. Although the bag is on the smaller size, it is large enough for a Kindle or trade paperback as well as a few essentials.	0
The fit is true to size, good quality, nice weight to it. Looks nice on my boyfriends hand. He was originally concerned it looked a little girly but once he saw it in person he really liked it.	0
I haven't had the water tested yet for fluoride removal, but the water tastes pretty good.  The capacity is excellent and the water is filtered quickly enough. I am considering buying another pitcher, but wish a larger-capacity container was available, like the 18-cup Pur that I also own.	0
it's very fast delivery.. When we went abroad in Asia, Europe. The power adapter was tired specifications differ from each other. This is all like. If only one with this power strip is enough. I recommend to you. In the light must travel luggage.	1
Avoid this book at any cost. Very amaturely written and a lot of grammatical errors.<br />The least the author can do is at least get the book formatted properly. The typos and and basic capitalization's errors are in your face.<br /><br />Also will give it 2 stars as it can do much better.	1
This game is going to be awesome i'm getting pokemon white but not because of zekrom but because of the style of it compared to black version. To the other comment here reshiram is better then zekrom when you look at the stats you'll see reshiram is better.	1
This light bar is extremely bright much better than I expected. Looks as good as the expensive brands.	1
The worst experience ever .. it doesn t work at all , all the channels are freezing all the time. The customer service keep saying they r updating and solving the problems but nothing happened<br />Really its a waste of time and money	1
I bought this for a B & G Macaw that I am fostering, but it turns out she doesn't like me, so I can't get her to step up to go to it.  We are going to be returning her and getting Quakers.  Since we can't return this at this point, we are making appropriate changes to adapt it for the two new birds.  This basically just means we are removing the larger sized dowel &#34;steps&#34; and replacing them will small natural branches.  I added lots of toys from both the top and sides.  I hope they like it when they get here...	0
I love this TV., It's wideness and the picture quality is superb! I usually play movies via external HD, My kids play video games and my husband watches basketball with this TV. I can say that this is must have in every home!	1
We just used this hammock for the first time and love it. We are using it our tree straps and S hooks rather than the line that was provided.	1
I was hoping to increase the amount of vigor in my workout. This did not help me to do that, in fact I even felt a little bit more lethargic. It was a shame because I was hoping that it would give me more power to do more with my body. I will stick to drinking redbull, rockstar, monster kind of energy drinks because that's the only thing that works for me.	1
I have been happy with this machine. It was easy to set up, and I have played and recorded using both Videos and DVD's. The dubbing both ways has been fine. The recording quality has been very good, and I find the machine easy to use.<br /><br />The reason I didn't give this product 5 stars is the following: A few of the controls can be tricky to figure out, such as ejecting a video, and setting the channel. Also, although there are 5 different recording speeds for DVD, there is not a 3 hour speed...there is a 2 hour, then the next is 4 hour. Many movies may be just over 2 hours, and going to 4 hour you lose more picture quality than you<br />would with a 3 hour speed. However, overall, my experience so far has been very good, and the price was right.<br /><br />I would recommend this machine.	0
Sometimes its awesome when a collectable is rare. A little Mac amiibo bestows the owner with extreme bragging rights among amiibo hunters and punch-out fans. shipped fast and flawlessly.	0
I wish I had never purchased this book. Curiosity killed the cat, and now I am guilty of helping this man out financially. At first glance it seemed to be enjoyable and a very easy read.  It won't take the reader long to see how self absorbed this man is.<br /><br />I'm sure that some of this is factual, however it is quite apparent that tooting his own horn is more important than anything an actor or actress can contribute. There are many instances in this book where Mr. Bowers seems to take full credit for the achievement of others. One of the most glaring is when he seems to think if it weren't for him his friend would not have won the Oscar. There are many instances like this through out the book, and it doesn't take someone too long to realize that basically this man is a huge bore.<br /><br />He claims to have no regrets for his life and I believe it.  A long standing marriage to an understanding spouse and the loss of a daughter don't take up too much space in this book.It's all about the pursuit of tail for either himself or all his wonderful &#34;friends&#34; in Hollywood.  Anything of any real importance seems to be thrown in as an after thought.  This is his book and it is all about him.  Stories he relates about his &#34;friends&#34; is pretty much common knowledge to the average reader. Most, if not all of his &#34;friends&#34; are no longer living, so it's his word against theirs.<br /><br />To sum up this book, if you want to call it that, I guess you could say his life is fairly shallow. I'm sure he probably orchestrated hook ups for celebrities in his prime. Okay, he was a pimp. What I find some comfort in is the fact that all his Hollywood &#34;friends&#34; used him  as much as he liked using others. He states many times in the book that what he did for all those years ( pimping), was to make others happy. In his own mind I'm sure he believes this. Every thing he got in this life was on the backs of others.  If these celebrities were really his friends as he emphatically states again and again, he would have kept his mouth closed.	0
it was exactly what we were expecting and works great at a decent price. I would recommend it, great for car trips in the car with kids	0
These were purchased as a gift for my 13 year old granddaughter.  She loved these gloves.  However, they were poorly constructed and came with holes in them.  As I needed them right away for a gift, I fixed them as best as I could.  When the vendor found out my displeasure, they refunded the full amount of my purchase.  I would certainly do business with Summit Fashions again.	0
I've ordered this and the Afghan one...and each one is amazing! All the coworkers are in love with them..I typically carry this one since the afghan kukri is a little large....wonderful knives and amazing craftsmanship...shippings fast too!	0
The product is very helpful for me and also for my eyes,its quality and performance is also very good,overall the produc pleased me.	1
Everyone's new favorite seat in the living room.  We got the Earth color which is quite a bit darker than the picture resembles but it's nice that company even migrate to the chair.  We had to really help it fluff up after it was delivered by actually opening the bag enough to put our hands through and pull the compressed foam apart after it hadn't finished the process after three days, but now it just takes a quick tumble and it is super fluffed and comfortable again.	0
I had fun playing with this.  For me, these enhancers are great for special occasions.  I have never overdone the techniques, but these enhancers do make my lips look fuller.  The effect is fun and temporary.  If you wear lipstick and wanted to touch up the enhancement, I would only do so before reapplying lipstick/gloss.	0
My girlfriend gave this to me (She is too lazy to make reviews so she told me to do it for her). The size is great, it fits perfectly to me. I thought it is just a simple ring, But I love it even though it is simple but I was surprised when I saw the words inside it. My love is really sweet and I love her even more.	1
I really felt like this product did absolutely nothing n I took it for two months. I'm kinda disappointed. :(	1
I love this light, bought it for my bug out bag. Although I have found some other, cheaper, brighter lights, this one is great and will get its share of use.	0
&#34;SAME&#34; county code entry helps to limit alerts to only those events and localities that could actually pose a hazard, and it actually works very well!  If you've been dissatisfied with the poor performance or unwanted alerts from older, poorer-quality weather radios, you will find this Sangean CL-100 a welcome improvement.  The FM reception is excellent, and the sound quality is surprisingly good for such a small radio; not &#34;room-filling&#34; but still very listenable for music, and clear for voice.  AM reception llacks sensitivity and has noticeable 60 hz hum on much of the band, but in many areas, there is little to listen to on AM.  It's hard to imagine a compact AM/FM/Weather Radio that would be any better.	0
Bought the case, was a bit nervous about the low price.. Don't want to buy a new one next trip..case worked as carry on, wheels roll smoothly, and the aesthetic is nice.. Stands out. i will be ordering the larger size. Stop debating.. buy it. it is probably the one..	1
Excellent trigger gauge.  Great price, too.<br />This gauge is much easier and much more accurate than the spring pull gauges.<br />It also averages out the pull pressure so you get an accurate reading for your trigger pull tension.	0
My brother wanted this game for Christmas and says it is a great game to play. It arrived on time and before Christmas.	0
It stays lit for a longer period of time which is better for me because we have lots of mosquitoes in the area.	1
I like pizza so much, and I have it very often. So I bought this great pizza cutter. This is made from very good material. It is sharp, easy to wash and works really nice! This cutter is good for home using but to restaurants too! Best quality item for very nice price!	1
First of all, these are professional headphones. If you are buying headphones to listen to fully produced music and movies, do not buy these!<br /><br />Professionals use headphones like these to create those products for you, that's why they sound &#34;terrible&#34; to some.<br /><br />As a professional video editor/audio sweetener, I recommend these to my peers. They're comfortable, they fit perfectly on your ears (even for women) and they sound wonderful!	0
Obviously you are getting Crayola crayons, but what I like most about this is the container the crayons come in. The crayons are accessable from all directions, it has a handle to carry it and it can be refilled just by placing in new boxes of crayons. There is also a crayon sharpener included in its own storage area. The base is wide and stable so there is no chance it will fall over and spill crayons. My only suggestion would be a more permanent cover. We have kept the plastic cover used for packaging to cover our crayons, but a more substancial cover would have been a nice touch.	0
I have used Macintosh computers since 1992. I really have no reason to change. The price differential is much less then it used to be for a similar PC, which used to be the best reason to go there. If I were to attempt to calculate how much time I have saved by not having to deal with the problems of the Windows operating system I have probably come out ahead anyways.	0
It is a Multi Function color laser printer, scanner and dual sided printing/scanning. If you do not need this last option there are printers about HALF the size and weight. I'd go for it but my parents sometimes need the dual sided function.<br /><br />Well, it's a good printer for Office use. Do not even think on printing resolution pics on it, it does not output well, specially with other kinds of papers.<br /><br />Be also aware of the &#34;dial&#34; that keeps warning you to change toners when you don't need. Just look on youtube for videos on how to reset the toner counter on the side dial.	1
Bought this item to use at a party to project Family photos on to a wall in a hall, Worked just how I wanted it to with a large projection and clear pictures for the price it is a brilliant bit of tech it also has a built in speaker and plays a number of formats USB, HDMI, VGA and will play through a laptop I have watched a couple of movies through this on a USB stick projected onto my bed room wall and it is excellent. When I bought it I thought that I would have to have my laptop connected to play pictures through it but that is not the case and it also comes with a remote control. Great!!!	1
This is a nice microphone for general vocal use. It plugs right into my receiver at home with the included jack adapter, and sounds like we are at a live concert! We just love to play at random times, and this mic is perfect for that. Set-up takes like four seconds, and the battery has lasted months now!	1
I bought the plates as additions for when we had a lot of company over for dinner. They chip very easily on the corners. I do not wash them in he dishwasher I simply wash by hand and almost all of them have chips on the corners. I do not recommend buying these.	1
Great to have an extra battery and the second battery to put into the battery grip.  Canon batteries a bit more expensive  but worth the battery name and dependability.	0
Hilarious. Love every minute. From Pugsly's piggy bank to Wednesdays Marie Antoinette doll. It us a funny way to look back on my childhood loved the show when I was a kid. It is okay to be quirky. :)	1
My first "real" wristwatch from Mom and Dad back in the late 1950' was a Timex about this size with a chrome expansion bracelet.  I wore it proudly for years and just couldn't get enough of the "chrome plated" stainless steel bling on my wrist.  It was tough and durable until after about 4 yrs my body acids began to make it corrode.<br /><br />When I saw this one, couldn't resist getting it for my precious 8 yr old Grandson.  And he loves it as much as I did mine.  Keeps accurate time and provides him with that little bit of "waterproof" assurance he was wanting so he could play outdoors without having to take it off everytime he went out.  Fit's a child's arm nicely and the velcro'd strap is a great convenience for a stop and go youngster!  Yo Timex!	0
I bought other covers before but none have matched htis one! Heavy, waterproof and lasted through a pretty tough winter and looks great. Better yet my table is still clean and looks like i stored it indoors.	1
I replaced the bulbs in my car's instrument cluster. It was as simple as taking one bulb out and replacing with the LED bulb and so forth until all the bulbs are replaced. Be sure to test that the bulbs are properly orientated before buttoning up the instrument cluster.	0
Looks awesome in my husbands music room and he lived it. Appears to be very durable, will def be ordering more of these products	0
These make great kitchen chairs. The cushioning is very comfortable and it doesn't look or feel like it was cheaply built. Assembling it was really easy and, since I move houses a lot, it's really easy to load onto trucks and to move into another house. The only problem I have is that I should have bought 2 more for when the guests arrive.	1
I keep this umbrella in the back of my car and it's really nice quality, looks much more expensive than it is and haven't found a problem with it yet. I went back and ordered another one, I liked it so much.	1
This shower has the highest pressure feature and thats exactly what I was looking for,  I come supper when using this brand new shower head if your into your shower you should try this out you will like it if not you can always return it.	1
I purchased the bracelet as a present. The recipient loved the bracelet. It looked better in person than it did in the picture. The detail in the bracelet is incredible. It can be worn with formal or casual clothes.	1
Pretty tasty treat, but not very spicy (needless to say, it didn't kick my @$$ at all). It's a tad pricey for a relatively small product. The cashews do taste great in spite of lacking spiciness, but then again I've never tasted a bad cashew in my life!<br /><br />Worth trying out at least once for the sheer novelty.	0
I bought two of these to go with my newly purchased (and not cheap either) Tascam recorder.  These mics require "plug-in power" (different from Phantom power) which you might imagine every device provides these days.  Not so.  From what I've read (however too late), electret mics have very specific power needs in order to function.<br /><br />I tried looking for a reasonable power supply fix.  None existed, unless I were to buy a proper preamp or something.  At that point, you might as well spend the money on proper mics that don't need the extra gear.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  You must thoroughly double-check your equipment to make sure it provides "plug-in power."  Or else, like me, you'll find these don't work at all!  No signal, nothing!!!  Terrible waste.	0
My husband was excited to get such a great assortment of clips. These same clips were at Dillard's for $25 each. This is a great gift idea!	1
The watch itselve its good looking and very nice...but the band its very cheap and even sounds cheap compare to a $60 Stuhrling Original  that i got last year.	0
This is one of the coolest inventions out there! I have had mine for about 8 months now and I am loving it! The sound quality is great, the volume is impressive, and I've only had to charge the speaker twice in the time that I've had it (granted I don't use it every single day, but even on the weeks that I do use it every day, the charge holds well).  Five starts product	1
This is my 3rd exact TV and love them all.  For the size and cost, a 1080p with all the smart features, this is great!	0
I got this iPod since my son wanted it for his birthday. It looks almost like my iPhone. However, I find that given the price I think there are a lot of cheaper alternatives out there. So I wouldn't buy it again.	1
I really like this game, nice songs cool dance moves .. good job... I like the video plays in background	0
A wonderfully written story with a deep emotions  attached. I must lift my hat to the author for transferring Rennie's journey so beautifully into this story. A captivating and relatable story for many readers, this one is filled with difficulties we will face and the strength of Rennie Curran to overcome it all. Certainly an inspiration.	1
I am a preschool teacher, so this watch is perfect because it is not a very expensive but has style. Therefore, I don't care if it gets paint on it etc. Band Is very large, so I will have to have a few links removed. Overall, okay watch for the price.	1
Great ukulele. Finish on uke is top rated and performs beyond what I expected. Don't just think about one of these, you have to buy one. You wont regret. I intend to buy another with the natural finish. Cheers, Brad W - New Zealand	0
I am a fifth grade science teacher.I bought this for my class....the best purchase I have ever made.  It is so much more that just a microscope the kit is filled with experiments that kept my students interested and amazed for days. They couldn't wait to work with the the Whodunnit.  The finger print one wast their favorite.  The book that comes with it gives easy directions and keeps them engaged!<br /><br />It is well worth the bang for you buck!	1
These are the best underwear I've ever worn. They are hot on almost all body types, feel great, stay in place, and have a fly! It is hard to find well designed underwear with all that and the correct leg length, but these have it all! If you're a man... you need them and if you're a girlfriend that wants a sexy basic, you've found it buddies!	0
I ordered the unit on a Saturday and arrived by Wednesday! It was easy to install, even for a novice. It only weighs about 30 pounds max. out of the box. It keeps my apartment cool!	1
Great product. I have a few watches with really big faces and wanted something conservative but still nice. The size was perfect, I have an average size wrist. I had to take 2 links off most of my other watches.	1
This cracked really soon. It seems good enough??? Until it cracked, and I didn't have it but for a day or two. Sad huh?	1
Works very well making holes for leather belts. If unsure of hole size, I would start with one that fits in the current hole. If still too small, then go to the next larger one and so on until you get the same hole size. You wouldn't want to start too large or the new hole will not look the same as the others. :) Cuts right through the leather with a quick snap, but does indent on the other side. Simply flip the belt over align a very visible indent and finish the cut. VERY clean hole.	1
The set is really a bargain: they're well made and the case is nice (although I can't get one of the latches to close).  The sockets themselves are workhorses, and they're getting used quite a bit in my garage since I purchased them a few weeks ago.<br /><br />The only problem is the set does not include a 16mm socket, which seems to be common on the cars I own.  Fortunately, 16mm is close to a 5/8" so I can use a socket from my SAE set.  But I knew it was missing before I bought it.<br /><br />While there is a lot to be said for having one set with all the sizes you need, the price and quality make this a must-buy for a first (or 2nd) set.	0
This canvas log tote makes carrying firewood into the house easy.  It is sturdy and keeps any debris that comes off of the firewood in the bag instead of on the floor, which makes it easy to clean up (simply dump the debris from the bag into a trash can or outside).  We also ordered the Panacea 15919 Log Bin with Scrolls, which looks nice and functions well to hold the firewood in our living room.	0
This works great as a medicine cabinet for our office clinic. It has enough compartments for basic drugs for coughs, headaches, etc, and it looks very well made. It has a nice finish and it's a great quality cabinet all in all. I;m thinking of getting one for my house but I don;t think I'd be needing too much medicine. Figured our it will be a great storage for my craft stuff.	1
I've previously had a more expensive headphone extender from Best Buy, but it by default wasn't the 3.5mm size. Instead, it had these attachments you would put on it so you can use it with 3.5mm's. The sound would cut in and out and you would have to find &#34;just the right spot&#34; with twisting the cord around at its different connection spots to keep the sound clear. It was a royal pain.<br /><br />This one works perfectly. My only qualm is it doesn't have any way to retract the length when you do not need the full 12 feet. There's plenty of workarounds for this anyways, it just would have been a nice feature to add.	0
This car charger is definitely on the cheap side. It feels very "plasticy" and is extremely light and unattractive..<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />It does work, at least it has worked so far for the last few weeks as I use it daily on my commute to work and back.<br /><br />I bought another, more expensive charger for my husband (he has an iPhone 4S) and it just seems more reliable, especially when plugging it in and pulling it out.<br /><br />Other reviewers have had some very bad experiences with this product so if you want to roll the dice and try your luck, give this charger a go. For a few bucks, even if it breaks, it's not the end of the world...<br /><br />My recommendation is to pay a little more and get a better quality Apple iPhone charger.	1
The case cracked on the filter within three months. The only possible way it could have was by my lifting it slightly away from the tank to place a background.	0
No one could make this work. My dad got them for me and mom when we bought a set of carpets and wow were they useless.	1
Solid construction and works well. Only issue is that the quick-connect system sometimes doesn't stay connected when removing the drill from the wood. But this is only a minor issue.	0
Where should i start! The idea is good but the finished product misses the mark. The rhinestones are stamped on, mine our on a curve. I paid over ten dollars for expedited shipping, it got held up.<br /><br />They graciously credited my account for shipping. They also credited me six dollars since the stones are not lined up straight. I guess i am supposed to be happy... I do not like buying merchandise that in time i may or may not like. Generally, time does not improve my feelings for a product.	1
I experience a delay when putting vehicle in reverse until the monitor be come on. You could be backing up before the monitor showed anything behind you. You still have to rely on a lot of head turning.	0
Flavor is good, but super super crunchy--almost too hard of a texture. Also, this is a very messy snack. The dried beans are all loose and at least 1/3 of the beans are broken and crushed. I think the product tastes good and is healthy, but it is kind of a pain to eat.	0
This is NOT a review of this film per se. I simply would like to know why the extended versions of all three films are no longer available on DVD/blue ray, or, when they are, are too expensive for the average person to buy, not as advertised, or are in such shoddy condition that people want to return them for another copy or a refund. I find this quite shocking, considering the reputation and popularity of these films. I'm glad that I purchased mine while they were still cheap and easily available. I'll be sure to make the extra effort to take good care of them but, what the hell is going on here?	0
I bought this thinking it was going to be like a normal blanket. It wasn't. The pictures were misleading as was the description. In all actuality, this blanket is more like a heating pad! Very, VERY small. About a foot in length on EACH side. I was completely disappointed.	0
The packaging was great. I received it by regular mail a rather long box. As i opened it, it revealed an elegant box. It looks jaw dropping. But like I said above I was a bit disappointed at the beginning, which that feeling has obviously changed over time.	1
This is probably at least the 5th seat cover I have bought in the last 15 years or so.  This one is the least expensive and the most coverage and easiest to wash&#34;  The only thing I wish is that it came it different colors besides taupe.  My lab is black, my seats are black and grey and floor boards are black, but I would rather have this one in taupe than not have it at all.  It is well worth the money!  P.S.  My lab goes to work with me everyday, so it definitely gets a lot of wear and tear.	0
It was as advertised, the quality seems good. I like the push button clasp, easy to use but it don't get accidentally opened in daily activities. Much better then magnet type for me.  Product and vendor recomended!	0
Great price ($5.00 less than at the sporting goods store) on goggles that work well and are comfortable to wear.	1
Classic style compass just like I grew up with and for the cost a great buy. Everything you need in a compass for trekking in the woods.	0
The product that I bought cannot work with my TV. Although my TV series is listed as compatible, there is still difference by country. Unfortunately this information is not made known to me when I purchased this product. I only get to know about this info when I called SAMSUNG support.<br /><br />When I contacted the vendor about this info, they didn't reply to me.	0
Comfortable to wear not to tight. Good item to have for beginner who in the kitchen that are scare to cut themselves.	1
If you need to get into your garage and you need an extra remote control, look no further.  This little gem has a button that won't quit.  All you do is get close to your garage (this doesn't mean that if you're somewhere in the neighborhood it's gonna work) and then push the little button.  It's like having a genie and you say, &#34;Open Sesame&#34; only it's not voice activated.  Also, this device is so small, you could put it on your key chain or make it into a necklace for your girlfriend or clip it to your car sun visor.  Get this device and you'll be the talk of the town.	0
I got the book in a week, and it was in fantastic shape. Its brand new, and that's cause I ordered it used. I would totally recommend to buy from this account.	0
I bought this airbrush on may to replace my old single action airbrush that required a propellant canister. It worked pretty well on the first project, but 2 weeks later I started the second it worked well and after 20 min or so the paint stopped flowing  and the cup started bubbling I readjust the nidle and the same problem happened again  then I flush the pain and cleaned and disassemble I  clean it all up piece by piece then it worked for 5 min til I got the same problem. I cleaned it up carefully again piece by piece took a big chunk of old clotted pain in the nozzle and no more paint nor water sprayed only air came out the air compressor works fine not problems with it.  And as well wen I got this product the box seemed to be already open the airbrush was scratched  I build 1/35  tanks  and this was a pretty disappointing experience  I won't recommend this product  thanks	0
Good product, especially for the price. I can hear and be heard clearly on the headset.Love this Bluetooth. Can't really tell that you're wearing it and the clarity is great	1
The build of the bottle as a whole  is pretty solid. However, there were a few places, specifically the juicer parts where flash plastic got in the way of using the product. The build is solid and it feels good in the hand!	1
No word can describle my love!!!  My boyfriend said it suited me very well.This is a happy exprience.	1
Watch out!  I bought 2 boxes and had to throw them out.  Bigelow apparently changed the formula (so much for the secret that only 3 people knew).  It's now loaded up with cinnamon and really tastes like bad herbal tea.  Don't buy it.  Check out the comments on the actual Bigelow site -- I'm not the only one who is really disappointed by this.	0
The dial on the watch is not even black! It's a kind of moss green army color. The face of the watch had a tiny dent on it. It wasn't what I expected but the style is still attractive.	0
Terrible compass. It seemed to work in the store, but when I got into the car and removed it from its package it became stuck at sxsw regardless of how I held it. Don't waste your money.	0
DisplayLink Driver crashed my brand-new work laptop (HP) twice daily. I even tried 3 previous driver iterations still to the same result. BSoD. Worked great when it wasn't crashing my laptop. I returned it and uninstalled the driver, no more BSoD.	0
Great movie. Not an Angelina Jolie fan normally but this was awesome. Watched it with a 3, 5, and 6 year old and they loved it too. Some moments that I thought they would be scared but they were not.	1
Fits well with my rode as well as my audiotechnica shotgun mic. I really like it. It's a very effective wind canceller.	1
There's a reason why other car chargers are cheaper than this one.<br /> I even saw one charger for $1! Unsurprisingly it has a tonne of 1 star reviews.<br />This one is a quality product. Happy with the purchase!	1
This paper is perfect. I use to love HP Photo Paper, but after printing some photos, the people look like dark monsters. I first found this paper on sale at Office Depot "Canon Photo Paper Plus Glossy II Paper" for $6.99. Oh, silly me, I just wish should of brought every pack off the shelf at that time. I am still waiting for sales on this paper. I mostly use the 8.5" x 11". Never use the 4x6 or the 5x7, but I assume they are great also. I just wish Canon would sell special packs of 8.5" x 11" 100 sheets, because this paper can be pretty expensive just for 20 sheets by itself. Would recommends to others and purchase again.<br /><br />Thank you	0
I'm not a gamer, but my son is and he just loves these headphones. Why not, he can shut me out and really immerse himself in his games. Which may or may not be a good thing. I limit him to an hour a day after he's done his homework and that seems to be working okay.<br /><br />However, gaming isn't all these headphones are about. I use them for listening to my iTunes playlist while I'm writing in the early hours of the morning. The sound is sublime, nice deep bass  and perfect trebles. With these I immerse myself in my music and my writing while my family sleeps. So these headphones get five stars twice, once from me, once from my son.	1
Like several other reviewers I'd been using SM58's until trying these out and was blown away. We use these for vocals in both a rehearsal studio environment and live performance. They run thru dbx 286A preamp/compressor/gates in normal use but when we got the first one I a/b tested it against the Shure straight into the console as well. Here's my rundown:  * sonically they have wider response, just a little bit more at the bottom and noticeably more extension at the top. To my ears it's slightly warm but with a good sense of air, not rolled-off.  * very good off-axis rejection, this mic has practically eliminated feedback issues for us without resorting to hard gating like I had to with the 58's. On the other hand, our singers have to remember to sing more directly into the mic. Minimal proximity effect as well. Plosives are well controlled, about the same as the Shure.  * sturdy construction, minimal handling noise, good weight balance, feels slightly heavier than the 58.  * first reaction when the band saw them was "ooo sexy". I dunno about sexy but it IS a nice looking mic.  Overall these are a nice improvement. I have now replaced my 58's with e835's and could hardly be happier with the results. Microphone qualities are highly subjective so listen to both back to back if at all possible, and decide for yourself! The e835 may not be right for you but in my case have exceeded expectations.	0
Bought this wig for a community theater play to wear for about 10 minutes onstage each day. Fantastic product! Looks just like the picture. Good price. The wig comes in a solid, hard box with netting; great for re-storage. It's thick enough and definitely does not have bald spots. The top curls are well secured with some kind of bobby pins. The side curls held up very well after two months of handling (taking it out, putting on, repackaging). It has elastic straps inside for size adjustment.<br /><br />Things of Note: I tried it first with just my hair pinned up. It was a little loose and the next strap adjustment notch was too tight on me. Next I tried it with a cheap wig cap which really made the wig slide around. The cap got a run after the first usage and got tossed anyway. What I found worked great for me was a pair of control top panty hose with the legs cut off and tied to make a wig cap. The ribbing texture on the hose gave the wig something to grip to and it stayed on securely and comfortably, even through some light activity (tilting head back and a slight skirmish with other characters onstage). Recommend also using a few bobby pins for extra security. The last thing any actress wants is to lose her hair onstage.<br />The bangs are a little long and do have a tendency to get in one's eyes. The plus side is they are very thick and don't look cheap. I suppose you could trim them, however I couldn't bear to cut such a beautiful wig.	0
Bought it for my son. Loved it, played it myself. who doesn't love the Joker? When you see where the Scarecrow takes you it will blow your mind. Frankster says family fun for all !!	1
Exactly as described.  I have it on my kitchen counter and it charges my iPhone and my iPad while also streaming music.  It doesn't take up a lot of space, looks nice, and sounds great.	0
I always be ready for any mess when I cut vegetables and fruits. But it is always a frightened thing to use sharp knife in kitchen. So I searched for any protection. Many many article say that I should use hand protector Safety Gloves. Then I found it. Kaffyad's level 5 Cut Resistant Kitchen. I am very lucky ti have it. No more fear making salata from cucumber and tomato. Highly recommended.	1
Thanks Black and Decker for a wonderful product.  My portable screw driver is once again working, and this battery has lots of power to run it for many hours.	0

I have a full set of copper cookware that hangs over my sink on a rack. I've had it for 35 years and while I rarely (if ever use it) I like the look of it hanging there. It gets pretty grimey and tarnished and some spots are impossible to clean. I looked forward to this product, but found that it did not clean very well. Maybe if I spent an hour rubbing and rubbing it might do the job, but with 14 pieces who has the time and the 1,000 rags/paper towels. So I cleaned my set using that old faithful since 1882 Bar Keeper's Friend and then cleaned with Maas and yes, more tarnish came off. And it was worth recleaning and there is something in Maas that keeps the tarnish away longer than anything else. Perhaps it is because you don't use water to "clean" it off that protects the shine. So I am happy enough with that.	0

My 12 year old son bought this with his own hard-earned money, but he only used it a few times.  He says it is uncomfortable because you have to sit almost upright.  Also, he couldn't get the speakers to work correctly.  The connections are dated.  I called customer service for assistance and left a message but never heard back.  This is practically brand-new and Craigslist bound.	0
the quality was better then expected I would have liked better directions. Over all it was easy to assemble and I may buy another one in the future!	0
Excellent quality product. Very recommended. liked it so much I'm ordering another. Simply too. Can buy without fear of being happy. I highly recommend!	1
I have been using a welding water cooler for some time now and surprisingly are the best. The TIG Torch Welding Water Cooler allows you to run machines at high amperage at the same time maintaining your torch cooler for longer periods. It is not only lightweight but is also easy to connect to the TIG welder. Bought it at the best price!	1
I gave as a gift to someone that recently moved to South Carolina. She loves palm trees. This was perfect for her. It's sterling silver so it won't tarnish and the cz's look just like little diamonds. No one would ever know the difference. It's truly worth the money.	0
Perfect to keep energy up when in front of the computer all day. I ordered it to replace an old box style Ott light purchased many years ago. Replacement bulbs for that are no longer available and it had lost its brightness. I used to leave it on all day long. This light is VERY bright and I like the fact that you can use it for 30 to 60 minutes. I probably have it on for 30 minutes 3 to 4 times a day.	1
rapido y seguro el servicio me gusto el producto porque era justo lo que vi es justo lo que me llego	0
I bought these as a gift for my husband, because he likes to try different sauces.  I also bought a different pack, but these had good reviews so I decided to give them a try.  Boy am I glad that I did!  He loved the selection, and thought they were very tasty.  My brother-in-law was visiting one day, and asked me where we had gotten them.  He said he received some a few years ago, and loved them but could never find them in the store.  I directed him to Amazon.  I would purchase these again, and I do recommend them.	0
I purchased this walker for my 95 yr young uncle who felt walkers were for OLD people.  He uses it for stability and is pleased that it enables him to walk faster!!!<br />It was a breakthrough as he had convinced my cousins he didn't need this help!	0
I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this book.<br />I knew that the POV would switch to Danaus before I even started Pray for Dawn, and therefore, I was a bit hesitant from the start. I usually don't like changes in POV, and often times authors are accused of using this strategy as a cheap "cop-out" method when they don't know how to convey feelings of secondary characters.<br />Well, there's no "cop-out" here, and book 4 delivers a much-needed break from the formulaic repetitiveness of the first three installments. I was afraid that Mira and Danaus would yet again fly to a far-away destination to prevent the Naturi from wreaking havoc. However, that was not the case here.<br />In Pray for Dawn, Danaus is finally confronted with the being that holds part of his soul. Through various efforts, the bori tries to manipulate Danaus and Mira to set him free, so he can permanently roam the earth.<br />A few of the characters we know make an appearance, but most of the air-time is dedicated to Mira and Danaus.<br />Unfortunately, there were also some inconsistencies, but they can be overlooked.<br />For one, Danaus has several strange encounters with Mira where she acts totally out of character.<br />For example, she calls her car her "baby" and she makes several passes at Danaus when you least expect it.<br />Also, some of the plot threads are repeated and some of the interior monologue gets re-hashed to bits.<br />Despite its flaws, Pray for Dawn offers a nice change from the non-stop fighting action of the first three books.<br />Mira and Danaus spent a lot of time together getting to know each other better as she brings him deeper into the world of Nightwalkers.	0
This movie managed to fill in the blanks of the original alien film extremely well, while not only retaining the original mystique, but actually adding to it!  I loved it as I do all of Ridley's sci-fi stuff.  Fantastic!	0
I love the tights. they are very well made. I am a fishnet fanatic and these are awesome. Very happy with my purchase.	1
Lock works great, particularly integrated into a z-wave network (I am using a VeraLite).  Installation and setup was easy and immediately worked great under z-wave control.  I purchased this after mixed results with the Schlage z-wave lock and highly recommend this over that if you are trying to decide between the two.  If it weren't for the price, I would have gone back and replaced my Schlage as well.	0
Awesome gift for the Godzilla lover who already has everything. Light is very bright and design is really cool. Loved it and worth every penny. Highly recommend.	0
It's a bit smaller that I would expect and the color is a little darker than the picture suggests, but it is very sturdy and nice. Very nice luggage!	1
i love this set of rope, i found them very helpful and efficient for my exercising , i can see that they are made in a good look that seems to attract me from distance, i didn't buy it from amazon though but considering the price i hoped to get it from here, it's so cheap and durable i just love it!!	1
This is a good bow, set at the factory at around 41# and 27" draw length - with a few caveats. The rest is a rigid piece of plastic - for me it's the first thing to replace (with a good fall away or whisker biscuit, your choice). The 3 pin sight is usable - but this bow does not come with a peep. And a heads up, many of the draw length or weight adjustments will require a bow press and a qualified individual, most in fact. Finally, the quiver is a bit close to the riser, too close to use comfortably with my rest installed - you may wish to get a better one of these. Considering that I can have this set up hunting ready (for me anyway) for a total cost of under 200, I'd say it's worth it, though.	0
Exactly what I expected. Great quality and really shows well. I've received nice compliments . Would buy again.	1
Maybe it was just a measure of my lack of "geekness", but I didn't realize it wouldn't stream from Amazon (my primary planned use) unless I bought another $80 part from Sony until my bro-in-law came to install it for me. Bummer! I thought about buying the extra part until I checked the price for a model that had it included in the system. After that it was an easy choice to return this one and buy the S590 version for $139; even with the return fee, it was cheaper and a better model for my intended use.	0
Buying another one for another room. Really handy, works well, I have had no problems with my Nexus 5 charging.	0
Cheaply made ofmilght weight plastics. but for the price I should not complain. It should last one season andnthe sole should be crushed. If you want something to last, spend more money.	0
I used this mount on my Remington 870 12ga. This mount is light wt.,sturdy,easy to mount,looks like it belongs (not an add on) and holds tight.	0
I've been using Epson products for forever and have never been disappointed. First off, if you ever (and it's rare that you have to) need to call their customer service, they are informative and friendly and second off, Epson just plain builds great products. This printer married quickly with my iMac and is working as it should. But the crème de la crème with this printer is the beautiful copies. You can get printers for not much money all over the place these days, but it's the copies that count and that's where Epson really delivers.	1
These batteries worked fine. My only initial concern was whether they would be received with a full charge, and they seem to have full charge so thumbs up from me.	0
Worked first try! Dont forget to pull the tab between battery and terminal. Will buy another, great price and small.	0
My dogs love these. They smell nice and are a perfect size for the vast majority of dogs. If you had a very tiny toy breed you can easily break these in half without them crumbling too bad. My dogs get crazy excited whenever they hear the bag crinkling!	1
Decent item to give as a gift, resolution is a tad low though and additional memory is a must as there is hardly any internal memory	1
My second tank style Bulova. Wish they would put the instructions on removing the links from the band (push the oins out with an ice pick in the direction of the arrows on the links) . Great watch, great price and keeps accurate time.	0
my son was disappointed because the watch indicates water resistant but he took it in the shower, and water got into it also feels like its gonna fall apart in your hand. DON'T BUY. It wasn't working properly either, so I had to return it.	1
LED dog collar works well. Gets a little lost in my dog's fur (Lab/Shephard cross), but is very visible from the side. I feel much better walking with him in the dark now that he has the flashing collar!	0
just what i need for the moment, it comes cheap and it does work, i just hope that it will last more than a month, nonetheless it is still a great item	1
Great condition, no problems, beautiful pictures used with a nikon d90. Good quality construction so far. Wish the price was less.	0
While the size of this bag is exactly what i wanted and its construction was adequate for my purposes, the coating on the inside of the bag was totally toxic.  Airing it out did not help one little bit.  If you are even remotely sensitive to chemical odors, don't even think about this bag as you will be returning it post haste.	0
Making your loved one feel that you love her doesn't end when you get married, it still continue until life takes you last breath away. Every time my wife and I will have a fight, I make it a point that I won't let the sun down that we haven't been okay. I usually sing her a song that will make her heart melt. This is really a great help for me.	1
I had been looking on several different websites for an engagement ring that was in our price range and that I could picture myself wearing the rest of my life. Eventually all the white diamond rings looked the same and I couldn't decide on any. Then I saw this one. At first I wasn't sure about getting a black ring, but it's absolutely gorgeous. Even though it's a black diamond ring, it still sparkles. The picture on this site doesn't do the ring justice, it's gorgeous. It is unique, and definitely suits my personality.	1
WOW! this frame surpassed all of my expectations! It looks 10 times more gorgeous in your hands! Similar ones in Staples or Office Depot go for over $20 so this is a GREAT value! It looks amazing on my wall! I highly recommend this frame and will definitely purchase more. The frame has a beautiful finish and looks very rich and very expensive :) Happy buyer here!	0
The series was great up to this point.  This book is so ridiculous that I had to skip over most of the psychic conversations. Yes, that's ENTIRE conversations in their heads. Skip it or read it and pretend the conversations are spoken out loud.	0
Do not recommend! We use (soon to be used to) this for a baby monitor and it would always disconnect! What's the point of this if it disconnects during the night!	1
As an old BB user, I was expecting more from the new BB Q10, but I am a bit disappointed now.<br />PROS:<br />-nice design<br />-nice keyboard<br />-good display<br />-16GB and 4G<br /><br />CONS:<br />-low battery life<br />-takes forever to boot<br />-slow in different common operations (ie: opening the Contacts list)<br />- materials of which it is made are cheaper compared to the old models<br />- bad pictures quality	1
Do not waste your money on this catsuit since you will get why you paid for. The suit is made of a plastic like material and has NO stretch to it at all. This looks NOTHING like the photo at all. Save your time and money.	1
I purchased 5 different types of seeds from ROBsRAREandGIANTseeds. 2 different types of blueberry plant seeds, 1 type of strawberry plant seed, 1 type of blackberry plant seed & 1 type of watermelon plant seed. ALL of these seeds were sown in a plant house environment. The only seed that sprouted was a single watermelon plant. Not a single blueberry, blackberry or strawberry plant sprouted from the seeds purchased from ROBsRAREandGIANTseeds.<br /><br />At the same time as planting the seeds listed above, I also planted several tomato, cucumber & pepper plants seeds that were purchased from another supplier. They all grew as expected<br /><br />DO NOT BUY SEEDS FROM ROBsRAREandGIANTseeds IF YOU EXPECT THEM TO ACTUALLY SPROUT & GROW. THESE WERE THE WORST SEEDS THAT I HAVE EVER BOUGHT!!!!!!	0
Amazing. While using this product was very pleased. It's just a good night's sleep. It will be able to feel tired pulleys. It allows fully block out noisy surroundings. I strongly recommend this product.	1
Both sides are very hard and sturdy, the rubberized side almost makes zero difference. I thought that the rubber side would be a bit softer to make this more versatile.	1
This supplement is very good, helped me to improve my health and my performance as an athlete, it gives you extra time to do your exercises and also has no Secundary effects is excellent	1
This set of knives is perfect for cutting cheese whether you are a connoisseur or a casual lover of cheese (and really, who doesn't love cheese?). The wide blade has enough breadth for “scooping” soft, crumbly cheeses, and the pointed blade will have no problem working through any chunk of parmesan you pick up. If you're cooking dinner for two tonight, prepping your meals for the week, or throwing a large party over the weekend, you will only need to buy one set of cheese knives, and this is it. While the set comes with a lifetime warranty, this guarantee seems almost redundant, as the knives are so sturdy that I can't imagine any of them ever falling into disrepair. Take it from me: I love cheeses of all kinds, and owning this single set makes me feel even more inclined to explore new cheeses, for cooking and for eating off-the-block.	1
this is a Christmas gift for one of my grandsons I hope he will enjoy playing with it on Christmas day	0
....not damaged in any-way containing all listed parts and packing intact, sealed new, visually impressive and an earlier arrival than expected.<br />Now, on to the speaker.....i obviously expected the speaker to sound okay or i wouldn't have purchased in the first place. i took price into consideration, i'm sure better's possible with a hefty bank account, in my current situation balancing quality within my price range at times proven to be difficult....but....this purchase proved it possible.	1
I just bought this one firstly because of the many positive reviews I've seen so far, the kit was delivered 2 days after I ordered it, and because of the unprofessional work of a car wash shop near our area where I let them car wash our 2008 Honda accord but after 2 weeks, it became clouded again.<br /><br />So for the results, it was superb, I managed to make our headlight clear and new looking after 20 minutes with the help of the guide/instruction within the product. Though at first I'm doubting and a bit scared because its my first time doing it and what should I do if I wrecked our headlight, but it felt good in the end when I saw the good results.	1
It's pretty, but the pink wears off on the white rubber after about a week. Once that happens, it's not as appealing anymore. :\ I suggest getting the black and pink.	0
I purchased this as an upgrade for my brother in law's computer. It performs well enough that he can now play his games on his computer. For a basic gamer or just anyone that made the unfortunate mistake of purchasing a slim computer I would highly recommend this card.	1
The item is MORE THAN expected! I would recommend it to ANYONE. Thank you for the fine product. Sincerely, William M. Imhof	0
I am trying to consolidate 50 carosels full of old color slides to a couple of CD's.  The Veho is exactly what I needed to get the slides into my computer where I can work them into albums for printing, photos for viewing, and CD's that we can show on television.  It has enabled me to clean out an entire closet and store the contents on two discs.	0
Great phone but I am not a fan of the operating system. This is something you can't try out when buying over the internet. I recommend shopping in the stores to choose the phone, then go back to order for the rock bottom pricing.	1
I ordered an iPhone 5 case. But you spent the earphones. At first I did not know what this is. I was soon know. It's that pink I ordered a pink case, but you had a pink earphones. Imitation iPhone Earphones	1
I think that I did something wrong that bubbles were coming out on the second day after me and my girlfriend stuck this into her kitchen wall.<br />but anyway it was great while it lasted sadly for us just a few days after my girlfriend bought it.	1
There seems to be no shortage of cable standards on the market today, and there is no sign that these trends will tapper off any time soon. I've been perfectly happy with my component-cable connection for my audio devices. Sure, having too many components can be a major hassle and contributes to the proliferation of cables behind your electronic media center. But I was unpleasantly surprised when I found out that my latest HDTV did not support component audio and I had to purchase a separate optical cable.<br /><br />Fortunately, Amazon offers a very competitively priced good quality optical cable. As I already mentioned, I haven't had much of an experience with these cables, but AmazonBasics Digital Optical Audio Toslink Cable seems to be as good as you could possibly hope for. It is durable, flexible, and long enough to connect any two devices. The sound quality is exceptionally good and only limited by the audio system that you are using. There is absolutely no reason to buy a more expensive cable from a different brand. I highly recommend it.	1
Love this set, I use it everyday when i take my newborn out places. I don't use the bottle holder though, but that's just me. I Love that this set comes with a changing pad, that's super helpful in bathroom or when I'm over someone's house.	1
Rita's book have been in the market for almost 15 years now and I studied it when I took the PMP exam first time in 2007. I got busy and failed to collect 60 PDUs and recently had to sit for the exam again. I was never crazy about Rita's book but when I took the test it was my only option. This time I did a lot of research to find out the best PMP book in the market which not only will help the reader to pass the test but also help them understand real life project management with case studies and scenarios. Below is my finding:    Professor Sohel: This book is the best in every possible way. It is written in a language that anyone can understand and mostly every concept is explained with examples. It has summary tables after every topic which is simply spectacular, questions are exactly what you will see in real life exam, extremely structured and well organized. Loved this book. It's very new in the market so I don't think a lot of ppl know about it yet but I am 100% sure that this one will be the number one PMP book soon.  http://www.amazon.com/Project-Management-Professional-Certification-Exam/dp/1492310549/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381180&sr=8-1&keywords=sohel    Rita: I will consider Rita's one the second best in the market. It is some time hard to follow and digest. Questions are not as good as the first one.  Head First: I also like this book because it makes sense and easy to follow.  I think a lot of ppl will not appreciate cartoons and images in a PMP book but I liked it.  Questions are not too good but comparing others it does a good job.  http://www.amazon.com/Head-First-PMP-Jennifer-Greene/dp/1449364918/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1412381221&sr=8-1&keywords=head+first+pmp	1
LOve this book, been getting for shower gift for years.  Every parent needs that gentle reminder that it's ok and this book gives you first hand accounts of other parent's experiences along with expert advice.	0
This is a very fun game to play.You can eat,socialize with other sims,use the bathroom,watch tv....there is so much you can do.This is the first Sims game I ever bought and I absolutley love it.Since I am new to the series,I am gonna check out more of these Sims games.	0
I purchased this for use on a TC compressor and a badger air hose connected to a velocity brush. It fit perfectly and works without any issues.	0
It was quick and easy to set up and just the right size for the window seat.<br />My seedlings are doing beautifully and will be perfect for planting in a few weeks.<br />I especially like being able to adjust the light source as the plants grow.	0
I bought these socks because mine were falling apart. I was looking for something that was a good price and had a great rating. These were perfect.	1
The bag is as advertised--heavy-duty and spacious--and suits my needs perfectly. My only (minor) issue is that the bag arrived with some bumps/fraying on part of the front flap (perhaps an imperfection in the fabric itself?). Since the damage is purely cosmetic and fairly minute, I really don't mind, but if you're the sort of person who would, be aware that the bag may not arrive in immaculate condition.	0
this product works great and I love being able  to charge multiple devices. Charges fast and frees up outlets which is always a plus when you have multiple people and phones	1
I had great hopes for this wireless speakers. While it works in principle, it does shut down my wireless network. Whenever the speaker is anywhere near my laptop, my LAN will drop completely. As such this speaker is useless to me.	1
bought this for a sightseeing trip to NYC and was pretty disappointed. 90%+ of the pictures<br />were dull and had a washed out look. camera took a long time to process the shot before<br />allowing you to take another picture. moderate and low light autofocus is pretty poor.<br />720p videos turned out great.  very powerful flash, almost too powerful for indoors !<br /><br />i'll likely try the DSC-HX30 for my cruise next month.	0
Exactly what i was looking for. With a little milk and sugar it's exactly what I was craving. Will definitely buy again!	0
Well, when you can't afford real diamonds... This is just as good.<br /><br />Great quality and it doesn't look fake at all. It's really sparkly and I am surprised how nice it is for the price.<br />The clasp is really great quality, and I haven't had any problems with it.<br /><br />Shipping was fast and it arrived in a nice box. Happy customer!	1
Great build quality fits with the controllers and PS4 very well, I like the idea of charging and cooling simultaneously in a very less time, no time consuming at all.	1
Really great athletic tape. I'm constantly getting my ankles taped to play basketball, need to immobilize my ankles. It definitely beats the nasty white most athletes use that leaves a mess after you take it off. Since it's called Fidowrap, I'm guessing it's for dogs? It didn't really make a difference for me, but I did use the white tape to mummify my dog for halloween. Worked great, didn't come off.	1
This is a nice alternative to using the oil based metallic markers that Sharpie offers.  I use them to write comments onto black photo pages in albums and they stand out as well as last a reasonable amount before drying out.	0
I got these batteries on time and they were performing as promised. worth every penny for reliablity. supplyer is a good source for hard to find batteries.	0
I haven't gotten much use out of this, maybe a half dozen mowings or so, but it has been great so far.  Setup took about 20 minutes and I had it running after putting the oil and some fuel in.  It starts on one or two pulls, and seems to sip fuel which is nice considering today's fuel prices.  The side attachment and bag both work great.  The front wheel drive is not the most desirable thing though - if you don't adjust the drive cable to make it more sensitive, you'll find the front wheels tend to spin out a little before catching - this just me nitpicking though.  But even if you dont use the self propelled feature, it's light enough to push without an issue.  If you want a nice self propelled mower with what seems to be a nice solid running engine, you won't be unhappy with this mower.	0
Not much to say. It fits. It works. It was delivered in a timely manner. And was the best price I could find for this pump. I'm happy with my purchase.	0
The perfect sports utility bag at such an affordable price. Its really hard to believe that such a quality bag priced so affordable. I needed a multi-purpose bag my badminton and crickets class. With this bag, I am able to put my rackets and cricket bat in the same bag, without having to worry about space. Other than that, the leather is absolutely fantastic and suits the rough purpose I meant to buy it for. Ecocraftstar seems to have all the categories cover when it comes to high quality leather bag, and not compromising in quality one bit.	1
I got this camera hoping to get something I wouldn't have to upgrade for years. I had tons of plans for it and couldn't wait to get it and start using it. Sadly, I wasn't able to do what I wanted and expected with it due to two main issues. First, just about 9 out of 10 shots I took, the pictures didn't focus correctly. I thought I was doing something wrong but come to find out, many people have had this same issue when I researched it online. Also, during use the camera would randomly turn off without any warning what so ever.<br /><br />After dealing with the issues I had enough and did some research to find a camera I knew I wouldn't have an issue with. Luckily, I found a great camera that I absolutely love. Every picture comes out nearly perfect and I love the way the interface is set up, much more user friendly. I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over month of using it as much as possible.<br /><br />If you want a great camera that you can count on, get the same one I did here on Amazon --------------&#62; http://amzn.to/1oapQK7<br /><br />I hope I'm able to keep others from making the same mistake I did and get the better camera in the first place!	1
A friend introduced this herbal tea to me as we do not drink any form of &#34;regular&#34; tea.  I don't usually care for most herbal teas as they have either little flavor or taste like steeped weeds.  This one has a robust orange/cinnamon flavor that is a very nice occasional treat.	0
I bought the G7 Power Boulder LED 0.5 Watt (5W) 15 Lumen C7 Night Light Bulb, 2900K Soft White Light, E12 Base 2-Pack in September of 2013 to test them out. They have been burning 24 hours a days since then and are still working fine. They definitely are as bright as a 5 watt bulb and are still as bright as when they were new. We haven't had any problems with flicker at all but the bulbs are in standard switch On/Off night light fixtures.	0
This item comes up under the Cat Dental Care department and the directions say "Gently lift dog's or CAT'S upper lip to expose teeth and gums. Liberally spray each side of mouth, coating teeth and gums" implying that it can be used for cats. However, the bottle says (in VERY tiny print) "For dogs only. Not intended for use with cats."<br /><br />I had to return it because I purchased it for my cats. I just want any cat owners to be aware of this. It should not be used on cats. I gave a neutral 3 stars because I did not get to use it. I don't want any cat owners to make the mistake of purchasing it.	0
My little guy watched dad build a deck all summer long and wanted nothing more than to help (he's 2). When he got this, first thing he said was,&#34; I'm going go fix the deck&#34;. He drills and screws all the furniture now. Hours and hours of enjoyment.	0
Size fits as expected but not as cute on as expected. Not sure what it is because I love everything I have ever ordered from this seller however this particular top just doesn't fit me the way I hoped.	0
Really amazing and excellent service.i really love this product after using this product i understood how helpful this is.Price will be reasonable and its quality is better then other. it has also a lot of colour and extra black cartridges. I am so happy about it..	1
I bought this protection plan after comparing it with Best Buy's protection plan for an identical product.  Their protection plan was $35 for one year or $65 for two!  Your Canopy protection plan was $46 for two years.  Guess which plan I bought?  You got it - Amazon's Canopy protection.  I'm really happy with it.  :-)	0
Got this for my mother-in-law and it is exactly what she was looking for.  The quality is not high, but the price reflects that.	0
What a wonderful tale the little mermaid is. I am so happy they were able to remake this movie (and many other disney movies) into DVD form. They are worth sharing with the next generation.	1
see its good but difficult in installation so you have to work on it first overall its a good product and the features are very usefull	1
I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!	1
We decided to try these new cages for our tomato garden this year (my husband usually had used the metallic ones), but these "superior tomato cages" were just a waste of money, as soon as the tomato plants started to grow a bit taller the cages started to bend, and those couldn't really hold the tomato plant, even with the lightest wind the cages were down! I gave up on putting the up (it's too bad a cannot post a picture of it along with my comment) so tomatoes were all on the ground.  These "superior tomato cages" were just a waste of money, they are going directly to the garbage!	0
If you like the idea of combining real dolls with your video game play, this is it. If you follow the tutorial, you will learn how to build levels and navigate through adventure worlds already created within the game.  As long as you watch the tutorial on how to navigate the game, you won't get confused.  One thing I hate about the starter pack is the fact that the figures all come from different games.  If you want to do any 2-player games, you are going to have to buy more figurines.  But hey, this is what it is: a starter pack.  It's not supposed to be a complete set, but when you do buy one, you can have up to four players with the internet.  So, I think it's worth your while if your kids are really into this gaming thing. Who knows? Maybe the next big thing will be the ability to reach through the actual game console screen and move your character around.	1
Worked instantly on Windows 8, very high throughput. I am using this on a Home Theater PC and am loving it. I don't know if it would be my first choice for a lap top unless I really needed to be sure to get signal, but for a stationary setup it is awesome.	0
My niece just got her PS Vita, so I got her this so that she can get started with her enjoyment with a little more completion. If you're going to get addicted to games anyway, you might as well go with it all the way.	1
I just got this tote in the mail today. From the reviews,I worry about the quality and the color, but once I got it, I love it very much. the color brown as the picture, and it's very speacial style. I like it.	1
I ended up not having the room I thought I would to put these on my handlebars, instead I mounted them on the factory front rack tubing. Done an outstanding job just as designed. I love the big elastic pieces that you pull down to secure your rifle with. The tabs are easy to grab even with gloves on. Holds gun perfectly even while bouncing across a farmers field at good rates of speed.	0
the delivery was great as promised. Now the laptop is fairly good as described i have had it for 2 weeks now. i use it for work, Im a  security system installer and i didnt want to go crazy spending money .im not a big fan of windows 8 . But the touch screen is pretty usefull . The screen and tge unit itself is much bigger then i anticipated. I would i recomend it to a freind ? Defineteley not for personal use. I would recomened to spend a few extra dollars and get something better. Its not that pretty i have seen  Better hps but inve again for the price and my so far experience its bot bad at all.could have been designed better smaller. And dont like windows 8 so i have it a 4 star. There custoner service is horrible by the way.	0
Love a good vegetable peeler.  This one didn't have any hiccups.  Easy to clean and mixed well with my other kitchen utensils.	1
I was a little worried this watch wouldn't look quite as good in person but I am not disappointed.  It is a great looking watch and my girlfriend absolutely loves it.  I really like the push button clasp as well.  It is much better than the hook type clasp on her other Citizen Eco Drive.  I highly recommend this watch to everyone.	0
Match the pearl strand I purchased.  Very nice, good quality, pretty bracelet.  Double knotted between each pearl.  Came in a rather large display box, really need a flannel bag for storing.	0
works well and exfoliation is very thorough. It lasts pretty long, but I change once a month for sanitary reasons. Not as fluffy after a few uses but that was expected.	0
I love these, my wife bought it for me and it's superb, the design is classic. It looks better than the picture. This is really a great, she really knows my taste. Though price seems high for me, but all in all its a great purchase. My wife is really the best. :)	1
I just retired my Keurig after two years of use.  I didn't want to buy another one, because the Keurig started malfunctioning just about a year after I bought it, I was tired of buying expensive K-cups, and I missed the treat of french press coffee made with fair trade, organic freshly ground beans.  So, I ordered this french press in green and some beans from my favorite purveyor, DeansBeans.com.  Overall, this is a good french press.  Don't expect your coffee to stay warm with any french press, as a warning.  They are made to brew the coffee, not keep it warm.  After brewing, press the coffee and then transfer to a carafe or thermos to keep warm.  My only gripe with this coffee press is that for me the press doesn't extend down far enough.  The press part stops at about the point where the green lines the bottom of the glass container.  I rarely make a full press worth of coffee, so I know I'm wasting coffee because the press won't go down far enough to separate it from the grounds.  Knowing that I mostly only brew about 8 ounces at a time, I probably should have just got a smaller press, but I wanted one that could handle more for when I have company.  I guess you can't have everything, but I really do wish that they would have made the metal pole on the filter just a bit longer so that you could still feasibly brew less coffee with less grounds and get all the coffee out of it.  (If you try to brew 8 ounces, for instance, you can only get about 2 or 3 ounces out of the press...I've taken to brewing 16 ounces, which gets me about 8 ounces out of the press)	0
I purchased two of these. Used one on the wireless router and the other on a repeater. After hours of changing positions of the devices (angles, rotation, etc.) there was at best a moderate decline in signal strength. Replaced them with  powered amped wireless antennas which actually worked and increased speed from 2mbps to 7 Mbps.	0
this is my second stand free basketball hoop, and they both were a little unsteady. However, this one is better then the last.	1
I'm still able to put this rickety thing to use, but I can't honestly give it a good rating. Structurally speaking, it's sound, but I can't make it stop wobbling.	1
I enjoy these stools so much I got another set for the office.  I use them as a side table, an extra step, and a foot rest.  I also use them as extra seats at the table.  Best price around...you could pay 5 x more somewhere else.	0
Helpful for organizing and keeping things together.  Paks are sturdy, roomy, and hold a lot of clothes.  Website has a guide on folding and packing if you need it.	0
I am satisfied with that mini camera, easy to carry, and the pictures are clear, I think it's worth the money.	1
Inexpensive and sturdy.  I used these for a Karaoke night.  The top piece where the microphone slides into has a small screw that may need tightening to keep the weight of the microphone from making it rotate downward.  But that is a 5 second adjustment.  I'm thinking about buying more of these for future karoake nights, just for the larger groups.	0
Loved the burgundy color. Very heavy robe. Measured myself to see if I would fit the robe measurements that were listed. I was within the XL size measurements but barely reached around me when I put it on. Sadly had to give to my granddaughter. She loves it!	1
i ordered this for myself thinking they would fit great but when i got them they were hugh . i guess i ordered the wrong size . but after looking them over and putting them on they feel great on my feet . very soft inside and nice and fluffy . they keep my feet nice and warm even though they are way to big . i will most likely give these to my sister for a gift . but over all these are very well made and looks nice .	1
This would have been the best roaster ever. HOWEVER, the manufacturer neglected to add the length of the handles to the length of the roaster.	1
If you're an obsessive tester, like I was, these are great. They were able to pick up pregnancy hormone 3-days before my missed period, or about 11 DPO. I did find that around half of them did not work (the main line wouldn't form, or a line down the middle of the strip would form where the ink had pooled). I followed up the results from these strips with a digital. They were accurate, overall.	0
This is a very hard bed. The mattress isn't comfortable and it moves and creaks every time my child moved. Not a quality product.	1
Satisfied with its quality. The images seem clear and better than some others I bought. The microphone is very sensitive, talking is smoothy through the camera.	1
For 3 dollars I'm impressed with this.  I wanted to give this to my 7 year old nephew and I really like it hahaha  I'll get him another one.  I'm keeping this.	1
This has been the best summer toy for kids and adults alike. Very durable and high quality. It survives twice a week trips to the lake with kids hauling it on and off the rocky shore.	0
Three of them were not working when I got them. They are just flat and obviously look like fake candles.	1
Fantastic - I have bought 4 of them.  They were shipped promptly and I am planning on ordering several more.	0
Works as advertised for the remote control in the Honda Odyssey Entertainment system.  Only needed one out of three so I now have two spares.  The price was reasonable.	0
Packaging was adequate. Product installed easily with screws purchased separately, since I have thick drawer fronts. The mounting studs are low on the pull, so if the holes are in the center of the drawer the pull will look high and off-center.	1
I just returned from 17 days in Paris. I purchased this hidden wallet just two days prior to leaving, and it arrived the afternoon before we left.<br /><br />It is fantastic. I wore blue jeans every day, and instead of putting this wallet inside my jeans, I put my belt through the loops and then put the wallet into my left, front pocket.<br /><br />The piece of mind of *not* worrying about my wallet being lifted was worth every penny. Because of the way I wore it, and because this wallet is somewhat flexible, I was able to simply pull it out, dig out any money or credit card as needed, and then stow it again -- without any problems.<br /><br />VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.	0
IT came very sharp out the box,  open very fast, to me it's a good EDC KNIFE, I THINK your knife should be ready for any task, work are self defense, don't carry a knife that wouldn't work for you!	0
This bed is great for my daughter. She is 13 and was able to put it together with minimal help. All parts were there (nothing missing) and all the holes lined up perfectly (rarely happens with this kind of stuff). No need to drill a bigger hole he use any power tools. She and her friends play on it all the time and nothing has fallen off or loosened, yet...	1
This is a cheaper alternative to the "String Swing" wall mount-- considerably less expensive.  It's easy to mount, easy to adjust and holds the instrument well.  However there are serious problems.    When I first purchased these I gave them a 5* review because they seemed to work very well.    However... over time the material they're made of can eat into guitar neck lacquer. In addition, the arms simply don't stay in place, tending to droop down and "trap" the guitar when one tries to remove it from the hanger... forcing you to use one hand to hold the guitar and the other to pry the hanger arms apart.    Further, the guitar neck may be stuck on the hanger prongs, damaging both the hanger and the guitar finish.    After several months, I cannot recommend these. The more expensive wood-mounted versions are far better. Or save some bucks, mount a piece of wood to the wall and screw in a coated U-hook to make a fine guitar hanger.	0
This is a very nice backpack for your laptop and other items. It doesn't have any flashy tags, colors or emblems to scream out &#34;Hey lookit me! I look expensive and probably have an expensive laptop in here! Grab me and run!&#34; The zippers are nice and don't seem like they will catch and tear the bag anywhere. I couldn't fit my 17&#34; HP in it, but the wife's 15.6&#34; Dell fit nicely. It does have dimensions that told me a 17&#34; wouldn't fit, but hey, never hurts to try.<br /><br />Heavy duty and comfy, the only downside is that it is a bit pricey, but a lot of times you do get what you pay for, and quality is not cheap these days.	0
This floor lamp provides soft, diffused light. It's perfect for a funky architectural element in a room. However, do not rely on it for a major source for illumination or as a reading. Well made and relatively easy to put together. The actual signature by the designer is a nice touch.	1
I bought this as a replacement for one that I bought a few years ago for $30. This one is much softer and warmer than my old one. Good quality and fits perfectly for my size. It's not too tight. I love it.	1
My major values (spare credit card, majority of cash and passport)were safe from pickpockets and purse snatchers! I was able to wear it around my waist and lower under my jeans - it was a great buy since I was traveling out of the hotel and between hotels for most of my trip abroad and I wanted to make sure I lost nothing important like the passport!<br />I got the nude and you couldn't tell that I was wearing it even with a white button down - great buy! It does get a little hot and sweaty if you were it aaaall day while touring, but it is a small price to pay knowing that my valuables are safe!	0
I'm a huge fan of fantasy, so I really enjoyed this book. I thought that the character development was pretty good and the story was interesting. It did get a little hard to follow in places and you really need to read book one before you read this book in order to get the back story. If you read the first book first, then the second book is better. But trying to read the second book without reading the first gives the book a bit of a disjointed plot.<br /><br />I recommend reading the first book before reading this one. I liked it enough that I will be reading the 3rd book in the series.	0
I realy like the color changing it's also working as a nice nightlight. I like the different setting to change the color.	0
I like this sticker, it's been on the back of my car (outside part of window, not inside) all spring, summer, and fall. It's still going strong! Now everyone who knows Trek knows that my license plate is a reference to Seven from Voyager, not that I'm one of 9 kids.	0
Very easy to install. Works great no issues. All programing is done from the phones them self. Very easy to move phones around and ext. Install take around 1 hour from start to finish. you can have up to 6 phones and up to 16 phones. Voice mail you can setup an automated attendant and also a schedule that turns on and off your night mode voice mail. would buy again. Also comes in different colors for the phones which you can mix and match if you want.	1
A must read for any inhabiter of NY and all who love and visit, congratulations to Mr Brendan Jay Sullivan!	0
great price. i get compliments on it all the time. Very unique piece of jewelry, looks great with a sweater or black dress	1
SMells really bad! Almost like rancid and old underwear.<br /><br />Do not purchase this. I can't tell if it is good on my skin or not because I can't bear the smell to even use it.	1
[[ASIN:1620062534 Five Drops of Estrogen]]In reading this book ,I was appalled at the authors words, as woman we encourage our daughters and our peers to fight for their rights and fly to heights that are unknown or discouraged by third world countries. Woman are treated with respect in this country. This is a perfect example of a man's insecurities and how to hide behind their failures. We encourage our dogs to be submissive not woman.	1
This solar light is just the answer if you want an inexpensive means of lighting up an out of the way area and don't want to go to the time and expense of wiring up to the mains supply. I've been using this light for several months now inside my garden shed. It's lightweight and easy to assemble. A sensor detects the movement of the door opening and the light instantly comes on, hence no more fumbling around, one-handed with a torch!	1
The interaction is what sets Chuckle's Revenge apart from ANY other movie that's out there... the entire movie can change at the touch of a button... BUT BE CAREFUL you never know what DANGER could be lurking around the corner!!! "ITS SO MUCH FUN, ITS SCARY!" plus... "Kristen" (Nicola Fiore) is a sexy addition to any movie! CR is a horrifically FUN and SEXY adventure from beginning to end... a must buy for any night of the week--and twice on Halloween!	1
The cap is too tight for even an average head and it pulls my hair out when I take it off.  I bought it to keep my hair dry when doing water classes in the pool but my hair still got wet due to sweating!  It just didn't work out for me.	0
Love this!  However, mine never look as pretty as the one on their packaging.  I save the mold, purchase cement from the hardware store and use the leftovers.  You can also purchase colored stones/glass from your local craft store.	0
My husband (the ringdemon gamer) absolutely loves his chair! He says it has &#34;great lumbar support, comfortable to sit in for long periods of time and the sound system is awesome!	1
Fast shipping and received exactly as described. This oil smells delightful!! Very good product and I am hooked. Thank you!!	1
I won't say that it tastes terrible but it's just a little odd. I'm not a big fan and neither were my friends.	1
This is a great projector with great quality. We use ours in a hanging auditorium room setting and the only thing I think is negative is that the do focus must be adjusted manually. But wants we set it, it didn't need to be adjusted - however I don't like that feature. However If u are hanging it then that won't matter. If you do hang it as long as you are running the same configuration then it also won't matter. I recommend it.	0
Finally........... a cover that covers and stay's put.  I cant tell you how many of those hard foam  "cups" I've tried over the years.  For some reason, I just cant seem to get them to stay put.  You pull it tight against the house and the strap comes loose, or breaks, or it leave gaps against the siding.  This "sock" fits SNUG against the entire faucet and house. You can tie it as tightly as you want and it's not unsightly. Stores flat, not taking up much space.  Just what I was looking for.  Small size fits out outside spigot perfectly too.  I put the string side down, then crisscross the strings, pull up and tie in a bow. No way it can be blown off or come apart.  PERFECT, EASY AND PROTECTIVE.	0
My son asked for this subwoofer on his birthday, so I bought it for him. He seems to like it so far, so that’s money well spent. I just don’t understand why he wanted it in the first place though. I don’t even know what it does.	1
I love the sharpener it gives a sharp point and quick ti sharpen. I just placed my broken lead pencil through the hole for 5-6 seconds and the result was extrodinary. Never in my life time I would be able to sharpen pencils this fast on my manual pencils. The price is right and Great	1
Appears like a good product. Got it for my camera and upcoming trip with included European plug. However customer service I could not contact via phone or email for a question.	0
To me, these earrings looked like any average cubic zirconia jewelry in the silver rack in most department stores. In real life it's a big main stone and the outer circle is smaller than appears in the picture. It does not look like fine jewelry or diamonds. However main stone produces a lot of sparkle and the earrings are sturdy and well done.	1
My wife love this so much and asked me to fill a review for it, advising others to try it too. You see even the size standard it fits more than expected and i noticed it cannot be teared due to the material made of so it represent a good quality product. Also it's so damn sexy! i&#34;m saying this because i love watching my wife with it!! 5 stars is deserved for this great set	1
I bought this for my Dad.  He wanted a green fedora and this pretty much filled the bill.  But the hat is on the light side. Almost flimsy.  I bought him a couple of other fedoras which were heavier and held their shape no matter which way you held them. this collapses at certain angles.  Once on the head you have to sort of shape it, unlike the others which just needed to be dipped at the classical &#34;jaunty&#34; angle.	0
- skip this item-  buy training underpants instead -  the pullups are glorified diapers (don't fit as well and more expensive)	0
The sensor has been working well to light up when I am near it every time. I enjoy the brightness and make thing around much clear at night. No more worry about finding the switch anymore.	1
Good study material goes a long way in helping one to be prepared to take a major test. The role of the dietetic technician is important to overall health of the population in general. Having a good study resource for the Registered Dietetic Technician exam is essential to you and your future clients' well-being.<br /><br />Flashcards are a great way to study for an exam. This set of flashcards is geared specifically towards the testing content for this exam only. Therefore, do not worry about other testing material or content getting in the way of your study process.<br /><br />There is much to cover during the course of the set. For example, explore food and nutrition sciences, foodservice systems, nutrition care of individuals and groups and more. Since there is so much information one may feel getting through all the cards in a timely fashion is impossible. That is not the case. This set is versatile. Take what you need from it, building on weak areas first in order to get the most out of your study time.<br /><br />This set is excellent to share with a friend or two. It may be possible for you to start a small study group with people you trust to help you get some of the studying done. Because these cards travel well do not worry about carrying around a heavy load or being bogged down with a heavy book. Good study health to you!	1
This is my favorite Star Trek Movie weapon. It's not as cool as the TOS phasers but it wasn't meant to be from TOS now was it? =)<br /><br />If you get this phaser, you or whoever you get it for, will not be disappointed. I'm not going to break down the entire phaser part by part byte by byte, like some reviews of items out there in internetland, so I'll just say...<br /><br />THIS THING IS TOO COOL!!! GET IT!	0
Still have a newborn w/ non-smelly diapers.  Stupid thing fills up soooo fast - way before the supposed # of diapers it holds.  To me - using a regular garbage can and taking the bag out daily makes a hell of a lot more sense.  Financially as well.  Shoving those stupid diapers in the thing is freaking annoying.  Can't wait til poo squeezes out of one and I end up w/ it all on my hands.	0
I'm not sure why this tin is so expensive. It's over $5 more expensive than the brand of organic ceremonial matcha (product of Japan) 1 oz tin that I purchased last month. Kenko's is not any better. In fact I felt that the kenko one has more of a bitter taste to it rather than less!	1
This is the only multivitamin I can take that does not make me feel sick. I've tried at least a half dozen different multivitamins, even gummy vitamins, and they all make me feel sick right away...until these. I'm thrilled to have a multi that I can take now!!!!!!!	0
This product is heavy, but what can you expect for the money.  I am disabled and can hardly pick it up.  I gave to my husband who don't known much about computers and he is learning to use it.	0
I purchased this Automatic Pet Feeder for my only one cat,my cat is so much pretty i love this so much.My cat control diet. As a result i can take care very carefully.One day i purchased this Automatic Pet Feeder. I choose this feeder because this is looks like awesome and it's have to wireless whisker automatic system.It's totally digital system.And it's price is so much reasonable,as a result i purchased this pet feeder.If you don't trust me so please you will purchased this for your pretty pet and use this.	1
Fantastic, love it it sprays in the wanted direction, and the tags of the spray patterns are on point,and its very easy to switch between patterns, the fact that it comes with two, just makes it a steal. I love it	1
Could barely smell it, and I used the whole thing with a quart of fluid too. It's like someone's breath after eating strawberry candy. I'd do vanilla next time.	0
Worst experience I ever had buying HP Envy M6 laptop from this seller.<br />System was labelled  "used - very good" but after I received it, I discovered that 2 USB ports are damaged, the finger print device is not working, the factory installed windows wiped off and replaced with a useless windows 8 OS. 4 indicators light do not light on the system and the system is obviously have been opened before it was sold to me.<br />I urge Amazon buyers to stay away from this seller. He has been cheated me!	1
This pillow really affected my sleeping quality a lot - in a positive way! I am glad that I bought it, I feel much fresher and better now every morning, it seems like that I feel like I am laying my head on clouds while sleeping! Five stars!	1
I bought this movie for a gift, and one of the dvd's skipped so badly, that my son could not watch it.	0
works 99% of the time, 1% of the time it will just go off. Id say its worth a shot though if you are considering it.	1
First cable I've had that I feel can withstand normal daily abuse without breaking. Sadly, it can't withstand small children using them as chew toys or I'd never have to buy new ones.	0
for my project i had to do some community work,cleaning the city for a month was not an easy job and i had to protect myself from the dust in the city,i purchased 3m dust respirator and rhey served me throughout my project.	1
I purchased mine from Zeldabelle.com so I can't comment on Amazon shipping speed... but if you're Amazon Prime member you know how great it is. However, I wanted to share how much I love this product! I got it for my son's 3rd birthday. He loves it!<br /><br />It was very easy to set up. You could do it by yourself but would be easier for two people - it took me and my friend just a few minutes. All you have to do is assemble and insert the rods into the rod pockets and tie it on top.<br /><br />I know other tents have strong chemical scent but this one doesn't. As I said earlier, I bought it directly from their website and specifically because it is USA made. Maybe I'm little paranoid, but I'm not interested for my son to be a test subject for Chinese toy manufacturers.	1
Quality umbrella. Have used several times in NYC on rainy days with fairly heavy wind. This umbrella holds up much better than the cheap $5 - $10 ones you find at Duane Reade or sold by street vendors. So far, the tarp has not &#34;flipped&#34; on me, which was always a pain point with cheaper umbrellas. Opening and closing the umbrella is also very smooth.<br /><br />Overall, looks and feels like a much more expensive umbrella. 5/5 on functionality and performance, plus a slick graphic design underneath the tarp. Very happy with this purchase.	0
Very good quality product. However it doesn't grip my rug as well as expected and I ended up having to superglue it to my rug to stop it from shifting all the time.	1

it is really a cute key chain pendant and i bought it for my nephew because he is so into jack sparrow thing and he just loves having a watch like these. its a great and affordable item .	1
This black light is awesome for finding stains I didn't even know I had on my carpet! Kids also love playing with it bc it's a black light rather than a flashlight.	1

This recorder is affordable and works well. Record quality for 2hr is good and 4hr mode is acceptable. I wouldn't go any longer than 4hr mode. For the price. This model has been great.	1
Can't say enough about how much I love this piece.  I only have a couple of concerns.  The top is very &#34;soft&#34; and after a small amount of use, I can see indentions in the wood.  Also, you can see the finger joints in the top.  It is not offered in any other color top, so I painted mine, but due to the softness of the wood, I am going to replace the top or have it covered with a stone top.  I can't say enough about the quick assembly process.  It took us less than an hour to assemble, as a lot of the product comes pre-assembled.  The height of the shelves on the end are not adjustable, so you can only fit small items in these shelves.  The inside of the unit is very roomy and the shelves are height adjustable.	0
just disappointed with this. it's easily blown off when the wind is strong. some displayed features aren't even there. and where did the tent hammer go? huh?	1
Every time I jump in the water with the Swim Audio iPod I am amazed that I am actually listening to great sounding music as I swim. This gadget, and being able to listen to music in the water, has transformed my swims from boring to exhilarating. The sound comes through crystal clear, and the earphones fit like a good glove. Really, probably my very best web purchase EVER.	1
I do a lot of baking and when you make the &#34;quick bread&#34; it calls for the 3 of these and this was a Fantastic product!!	0
Wow, with this new buy with 1 click feature I accidentally bought this watch and now im currently having my car repossessed, my home is being taken, my wife and kids left me and im currently living on the streets.... But I look balling and the watch is great! Well worth if I didn't accidentally buy it I probably never would of!	1
We really love this and use it daily! It's lightweight but sturdy and is very convenient. The design is very pretty and the fabric is easy to spot clean. I would highly recommend.	0
Fits my Bose headset just fine and matches the color. It was a cheap purchase with Prime and I haven't had any issues with it yet. The paint is already chipping off of the zipper pulls, but it's not a big concern. This does the job.	0

I could jump up and down and scream----I have FINALLY found something that eliminates odor. Yes, you heard me ELIMINATES it. It's gone, gone, no more smell. I have tried everything out there. Sprays, vinegar, you name it, I have tried it (my cat is a repeat offender). So when I watched "My Cat From Hell", and Jackson recommended this, I thought "what do I have to lose". If I could give this 10 stars, I would!<br /><br />I didn't honestly believe this would eliminate it, as I have tried every so-called eliminator, and nothing has worked. I used it on 3 spots, 2 of which were minor and one that was bad. My cat got a urinary infection, so she peed on the floor. The urine was a stronger smell than usual because of her infection. The 2 spots were probably only 1 time offenses, but the stronger spot was most likely several repeat urinations in that same area. I tried 2 different products on all spots, and the smell still lingered. The bad spot was still very strong. I then tried this exactly as the directions say, and the 2 minor spots are gone, completely gone. The bad spot took several treatments. I have a [[ASIN:B0016HF5GK BISSELL Little Green Multi-Purpose Compact Deep Cleaner, 1400-7]], so I saturated the area with the cleaner in the spray bottle and let is set for about 30 minutes. I then sucked the cleaner up with my Bissell, and repeated the process. The smell was gone in the entire strip of carpet, except for a lingering of it in one small area. You have to get down into the carpet with your nose to smell the lingering scent. I believe that with continued treatment, I can eliminate the entire odor completely.<br /><br />I will be buying a bulk pack of these things from now on. I'm so excited I might wet myself! Good thing I have Fizzion in case that happens!	0
A very useful item to--hopefully!--protect shipped items from rough handling. They stick well and are bright enough to be noticed. I would order them again.	0
B+W is the brand you want if you're looking for superior optics.  It makes zero sense to purchase an excellent lens, only to cheapen your optics with less than ideal filtering.  The 007M clear filter vs. the haze filter version was selected because it does not have the slightly yellow cast the of the haze filter model.  You'll pay a few dollars more but it's well worth it.  The Multi-Nano coating makes for very easy cleaning as well with no smudges.	0
I ordered a size 6 women and it wasn't even close. It fits my 9 year old daughter that wears a size 2 kids. Their great for her... but thats not what i needed them for	0
this is durable, but if you have a nice deck area you might not like the way it looks. it is basic beige plastic with a dark top. it looks very utilitarian. so if you have a colonial or cape cod house you might not really appreciate the lack of design.	1
This looks nice and was delivered fast. But, I cant hear through it properly because of the buzzing sound. Also, linking it with my device is such a hassle.	1
I don't have high expectations for this camera when I receive it. I'm not at all impressed of its exterior and had difficulty installing the memory card. But, when I view the videos recorded by the camera I was amazed how clear and colorful they are. Although its not high definition but it's crappy as well. You wouldn't be ashamed to show it the video to your friends. The photos came out really good, too. This camera definitely change my first impression about it.‏	1
Lasted for only one trip; the plastic clip on the female end snapped off cleanly. I found the strap on the luggage carousel conveyor. Maybe you'll have better luck. Nice vivid color; improved visibility; stayed snug--once.	0
have Pisector for a week now in my house it seems to be working fine,its very easy to install but i did use the mounting screws for added security to the door.so far I am really liking this product. i like that I am not stuck in contract and that I could install it myself. I would recomend this to friednds and family for sure.	1

play station is like the best invention ever, after Nintendo 64 of course. the gaming graphics are the best and i really couldn't be happier than having this type of gaming consoles, i bought mine on black Friday which really doesn't make a difference in the price but well it makes myself looked i spend less.<br /><br />the graphics are so much better with the HDMI cable, and if you have the HDMI you don't need to plug in the AV cables, and the best of using the HDMI is that if you turn on the console from the controller the TV will change itself to HDMI and the same when turning it off, it will turn itself to the channel it was (whatever you were using).<br /><br />i like ps3 better than XBOX because online is free and because the controllers feel more comfortable the controllers also are much better because they don't weight as much as the xbox controllers. the ps3 slim is a lot thinner than the ps3 before, that is the only difference, i really can't wait for the ps4 to be released, i heard is in october or somewhere around there so i can't wait for it. highly recommended. but i must warn you that you should wait for the ps4 which will be a lot more better than this one.	1
This case has a lovely decoration, very sturdy, the quality of this case is not like other cases you would find in ordinary stores, the material used has a soft touch finish, it doesn't allow the phone to slip around, and it definitely holds strongly.	1
I felt a nice tingle and the smell it great with this product. I have got a lot of the products from this company and they never fail	1
Love this Portable Fish Finder. Works as it should being that it is portable. For the price this is an awesome find. Tested this past summer. I threw it into the lake to find out depth and if there were fish around. Seemed to work as it showed I was sitting at 15 ft and showed fishing moving across the screen. It does not show size nor exactly how many fish are around but does show the differing depths the fish are sitting at. I was very pleased with this purchase and can't wait to use it again.	0
I use this serum for about a month now and my skin looks brighter, healthier and more toned, it feels baby soft. My complexion never looked better. My wrinkles are less noticeable. I love it! I plan on continued to use it and hope to see even better results	1
On the weekend me and my sons sit down and play xbox for hours on hours .<br />But unfortunately the council that I have does not have a cooling system. That's why this product is really amazing. because it helps me to keep my Xbox unite from over heating.

this came in good working condition no problems while playing the game. just what I was looking for thank you	0
Kim Sheridan has taken some time off from her school teaching job in a poor part of London to help her cousin out at the hotel she and her husband run, because her husband is in hospital. On the way she gets in a fender bender with non other than her ex-husband, Luke Savage, who, by coincidence, is staying at the hotel. They lapse into argument, because these are two people who truly seem to dislike each other. In fact, if two people never should have been married, well these are them.<br /><br />At the hotel, Kim discovers Luke is a writer, you think she would have known this, and that he is hiding out here to work. Then Kim's cousin is required at the hospital to be at her husband's bedside for a few days and now Kim is running the hotel by herself. She doesn't anticipate any problem, after all, there aren't too many guests. Then two of the staff come down with food poisoning and now she's in trouble. Then the ex she can't stand offers to pitch in and help and for a few pages there we think maybe he's not such a bad guy. Then more guests, friends of Luke's, show up and the books really takes off.<br /><br />I'll admit that at first I didn't think I was going to like this book. Luke is one of those self-assured, kiss 'em and they swoon kind of men that some romance writers like to write about, but that I don't like to read about, but he has character and lots of good qualities and that pulled the book up a lot in my estimation. A very nice and enjoyable read.	1

January 29, 2015: I'm amazed at the extremely hostile responses to my prior negative review. Isn't the point of a review to let other buyers know what I think? In deference to those folks, and in view of the fact that I am still using the printer, I changed the headline and added a second star. I'm not sure why my honest opinion bothers people so much. Someone suggested I could have bought a printer with a larger paper tray. Well, first, my choices are limited because I need old-fashioned fax capability. Second, it's the small size of the OUTPUT tray which is most problematic. And I'm still having trouble with the printer over-heating envelopes so that it almost seals them. My prior Brother laser printer didn't do that.    Original review: Would NEVER buy this printer again! It holds very little paper, either in the paper tray, or especially in the output tray. You constantly have to empty the output tray. And emptying the output tray is very difficult, because you can barely get your fingers into the tiny space. And it's far beyond noisy. Each page being printed produces a very loud start-up noise. I actually may have to limit large print jobs to after-hours.    Update after a week: I needed to print an envelope today. Twice the printer was convinced it had a jam, requiring me to open the drum drawer and close it. When I was finally able to print the envelope, it wrinkled it and almost sealed it shut.    I LOVED my previous Brother printer, so I'm especially disappointed in this one.	0
I really appreciate the authenticity in this book. Phil Cooke doesn't pretend to have all the answers. But, he DOES help you walk though some of the questions that will help you figure out your One Big Thing. And he brings it home by sharing personal experiences about how these principles have helped to transform his own life and career.<br /><br />The purpose of this book is to make YOU take responsibility for your calling, your purpose, whatever you've been put on this earth to do; for YOU to discover it and to take ownership of it and to move into everything that God has called you to be.<br /><br />And for me, that was EXACTLY what I was looking for.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that will challenge you, encourage you and motivate you--not by trying to conjure up passion, but by tapping into the passion that is innately inside of you--this is the perfect book for you!<br /><br />And don't forget to read the epilogue. That may just be my FAVORITE part of the whole book! Check it out! Cheers!	0
Very disappointed in this product. If it is supposed to have no harmful preservatives, then why do they contain chemicals that can cause allergic reactions. The next thing is all those ridiculous amount of five star reviews that are clearly paid for. Bad stuff, don't buy it.	1
This is reliable for what you need it to do, which is to make sure that you're heard properly, but this is pretty cheap too. There are some audio problems pertaining to the games too.	1
Awesome selfie stick! I've used it on all my vacations and I have been able to take pics at different angles with ease. This stick is so helpful! You can get everyone in the shot and take a pic with a self timer on the camera. Everyone who see's my pics and videos wonders how I am taking them. I'm really enjoying this product. Thanks!	1
Before the every day B movie rip offs of huge films there was mac and me, a blatant advertising knock off of ET. It isn't even worth your time.	1

Roughly the size of a notebook paper, this little chalkboard is incredibly handy.  It mounts easily to any surface with the included double sided tape.  We use it in the kitchen for reminders and little notes.  It is very light weight.  The faux wood edges look nice as well.  We're happy with this product.	0
The only official option for the Ouya is the only plus side to this controller. The buttons sometimes get stuck underneath the face plates (which actually fall off sometimes). There is zero guidance on how to put the batteries in, and even when you find out, it's still not easy. It fits with the quality of the Ouya console itself, which can't compare to the current ones on the market.	0
&#34;Jesus: The Human Face of God&#34; by Jay Parini is really a book that anyone with any interest or curiosity in Jesus would find interesting. No matter what you believe or not believe about Jesus, Parini brings things about this religious figure to light that I was never aware of which explains more about what his teachings meant and who he was.<br /><br />Jesus was a deeply religious Jew who was influenced from a number of Eastern AND Western religions. Taking this into consideration it gives us a different view and interpretation of what he meant by his words, actions, and teachings. The book actually has me interested in studying more about who this Jesus was.<br /><br />A fascinating and refreshing look at Jesus.	0
Nice for my 10 YR old son. Includes 8 creations! You shoul purchase this because it will last a long time so you spend less on children for lego, especially if they love minecraft!	0
this thing is built like a battle ship and performs well. it is a little awkward to clean but tolerable. It gives 2 serving size walls in the time most machines make one.	0
We have tried several of these in our diffusers and like the one tried so far. I have it a 4 because  I wish a booklet came with the oils to let beginners know how or when to use each mix.	0
We loved this on our cruise.  Good for all ages, can pack on our motorcycle trips.  Just a fun easy game.	0
love this watch.  the only thing that i find a little troublesome is that it's a little difficult to read the time because of the background and hands	0
I love this Glass Infuser Water Bottle by Dr B Goods! It is a high quality glass which is healthier to drink from than plastic. Also, you can use either hot or cold beverages with it. I love the protective silicon sleeve. That gives an extra added layer of protection to the glass and also your hands. The flip top lid is good and secure. So far I have used it to make different flavors of fruit water. I often puts lemons in it because that is so healthy. I have also used strawberries and even frozen berries. This is a great product and I am very happy I made the purchase.	1
I finally found the perfect organizer for my needs. The build quality is excellent, and even after loading it down with three passports, cash, and all my cards, it shows no signs of wearing out.<br /><br />The 50, 100, and 200 euro notes are a little larger than the smaller denomination euros and slightly block the zipper when you put them vertically, but it's not a big deal.	0
Just built my friend a new office computer with this chip and very happy with the build. Chip runs cool and does everything that she needs including graphics editing and excel spreadsheets.	1

I am giving this prep book 5 stars because the material was very thorough and conformed to the actual prep book, This presented an excellently organized laundry list of EXACTLY what I needed to focus on and explained the topics quite well. It guided my research and pointed me in the direction of all the material that would appear.	1
Ok this is one of those products you get what you pay for. They quality is awful so don't waste your money.	1
I was looking forward to a perfectly seasoned grilling experience, but my Sunday was nearly ruined instead. I had to make another batch of sauce from scratch because the mixture from the container spilled after I tried to open it when it wouldn't work. Really disappointing.	1

I was so happy to find this wonderful toolkit, with such many positive comments<br /><br />BUT to my dissapointed. it can't open my watch because the range of the opener is too small!<br /><br />My watch is fossil AM 4102, compare regular watch it looks little bit bigger,but the adjustable opener can't fit this size!	1
Although not very fashionable this harness works great! We have a Boston Terrier mix that is about 30 pounds and he wears it all day since we take him out often. The adjustable strap also makes it much easier to put on and take off than other harnesses that we have had. Just throw both loops over their head, pass their legs through the rear loop and adjust the strap on their back. Takes 10 seconds or less if your dog is cooperative. I would love to see this harness in reflective colors too (maybe with a slightly thicker/wider rope material?)	0
Bought for my Ma for Christmas as a joke as we have a doxie and she has cats.  Well she says they love to sleep on it and wants another- WIN!!	0
Got this today and its really awesome in my opinion. The light is bright enough you can see very well and it seems to be built great. I can't wait to take it camping with me in the Summer time!	1
My daughter absolutely loves reading.  No matter the topic, cuddling up with a good book is just the best thing for her.  So I thought it would be nice to carve out a small cozy spot for her in our house, and this pillow looked perfect.  She is SO excited about it- it's soft, portable, and pink!  No issues whatsoever.	0
This Lenovo works great for the kids, and even myself in a pinch.  Tablet is a little slow sometimes, compared to my $400 Samsung.  But that was my first and only tablet.  One other thing:  just after installing the first games for the games, the tbalet locked up, and need a hard reboot (have not been able to reproduce).  Kids love it,and it is very hardy, and takes a lot of abuse.	0
The Sony HDR-PJ380 is a miniscule, light weight video camera with a built in projector that frustrates me. On the bright side, the video quality is good, the zoom range is impressive (from really wide angle to stalker telephoto) and the recorded sound is excellent. On the dim side, the camera is an ergonomic mess, the projector is weak, the lens quality is sad.<br /><br />December 6, 2014 Update: In the two years I have owned this camera, it has proven to be exactly what I thought from the beginning. I used the projector maybe 4 times and that was just to make people laugh. It is frankly a worthless attachment on the camera. The clip to hold the battery in has broken. That attachment point is a really cheap piece of plastic. The only reason I continued to use the camera is the wide angle lens. I used to shoot volleyball matches in tight areas. The wide angle was a major benefit. This camera is a teeny tiny mess.<br /><br />This is one of those video cameras that seem like a great idea; include a pico projector so people can watch videos right away, no television needed. In practice, it doesn't work out quite that well. The projector is really dim, the room has to be pretty darn dark to see the video and it has to be projected onto a white wall. The sound from the camera is just barely useful (I still can't find the volume control). This camera is capable of really good HD video, projected the video looks sad.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this camera is the ergonomics, how does this thing feel in my hand and how easy is it to use. I could never find a way to grip the camera with my right hand so that I could work the record button and the zoom button. My hand was always twisted around in an uncomfortable position and I couldn't hold the camera steady. Using my left hand on the screen wasn't a whole lot of help either. I do have big hands. The strap cannot be removed. I could get it to just barely fit my hand.<br /><br />There is this ridiculous USB cable built into the camera with no way to remove that useless piece of computer connection. The thing is poked into a slot in the camera grip. Personally, this is just extra weight to carry around. The pigtail is short, plugging into a laptop might work, but forget a desktop computer. The box does include a USB extension cord (but hey, I have to carry that around to use the camera, why not just make the cable detachable like every other camera manufacturer).<br /><br />The camera has a power switch located behind the flip out touchscreen, which has to be the single dumbest place to put a power button. When the video screen is flipped open, the camera turns on. In order to use the power button, the video screen has to be flipped open - turning on the camera. The other two buttons behind the video screen are a play button which switches the camera into playback mode and back to shooting mode; and a projector button that turns the projector off and on. Once the projector is on, the touchscreen no longer works. Menus and video selection has to be done with the Zoom lever and the photo button. This was a combination that I couldn't master, it was almost impossible to use. The even worst part of this whole mess - whatever memory was selected in the Setup menu, is the memory used for playback and projection. What a pain in the rear to switch between the internal memory and an SD card.<br /><br />Along with the three oddly placed buttons, there is a miniHDMI input and output port. The box contains a miniHDMI to standard HDMI cable. There is also a 3.5mm jack for a microphone or &#34;plug in power&#34; (whatever that means).<br /><br />There is a tiny flip door on the side of the camera for some kind of multifunction connector (no cable was included for that) and the AC adapter to charge the camera. The bottom of the camera has a trap door at the rear for an SD card and the tripod socket is in the center of the camera. If a tripod quick change plate is mounted on this camera, it is highly likely that the SD slot will be covered. Oddly, the battery release can be moved from either underneath the camera or from the side behind the video screen door. This is another mixed blessing - if I have the camera mounted on a tripod, I can open up the video door, turning on the camera, and then slide the battery release to remove the battery, turning off the camera.<br /><br />The disaster is that all the buttons on the camera are virtual; meaning everything to control this camera is on the touchscreen. That would be OK if there was some logic to the menus and buttons on the screen. This is the biggest mess of menus I have ever seen. The menus are: Shooting Mode, Camera/Mic, Image Quality/Size, Playback Function, Edit/Copy, and Setup. The Setup submenu is about 50 selections all in some odd groupings that are accessed by scrolling down (not swiping like in an iPhone, but touching an arrow to make the menu roll down one page). Finding the settings I need is the most frustrating complicated thing I have ever seen.<br /><br />The lens on this camera is not good. Outside chromatic aberration was bad (this is blue fringing around white objects against a dark background). The 55X end of the video is so soft, it is just barely useable. I have a sense that there is some kind of digital enhancement for the far end of the telephoto because the image goes very soft. Oddly, there is a setting to go even further with digital zoom (I had this setting turned off, and the video was still horribly soft). The worst part of this lens is the coating, there just doesn't appear to be any multilayer anti-reflection coating on the lens. I have never seen so much front element flare in my life. I was shooting in a room with fairly bright lights overhead; depending on where I stood the image was completely washed out with flare. From the exact same spot, my iPhone didn't have that problem.<br /><br />The only good thing about this lens is the wide angle. It is one of the widest lenses I have ever seen. I shoot volleyball matches and this is perfect to get the full court into the shot.<br /><br />Still images are just fine outside. Indoors in low light, image noise is a huge problem - the pictures are extremely grainy. I would say they are just slightly worse than an iPhone in the same situation.<br /><br />The video quality is good. I have a Canon HD video camera (Vixia HFM400) and the video looks pretty similar between these two. Image stabilization is surprisingly good on this camera. It does filter out hand shakiness surprisingly well.<br /><br />The recorded audio is absolutely outstanding. This blew me away, with all the other problems with this camera; I didn't expect the sound to be that good. I recorded a friend's rock concert - I'm pretty certain the audio was up in the 100db range, it was loud. The camera managed to attenuate that sound and record it perfectly. That's a feat not many cameras can accomplish. As usual, the microphone picks up sound all around, so noise will be picked up from everywhere.<br /><br />There are some decent features that took me a while to figure out and find. I do like the focus follow feature; touching the screen on the thing you want to maintain in focus will then follow that thing around the screen keeping it in nearly perfect focus. The battery seems to have a fairly long life. The camera does weigh nothing at all - it is teeny tiny (shoot the AC adapter is almost bigger and heavier than the camera).<br /><br />The camera is very particular about SD cards. I tried an ez Share 16GB class 10 card, the camera got all finicky about recording to it. The first three minute clip recorded fine, but then the camera went into an impossible to leave circle of trying to recover images and files from the card. I eventually went back to the internal memory. The first clip was recorded correctly.<br /><br />Transferring movies to a computer is a living nightmare. For some unknown reason the computer can only see thememory that was selected for recording. So if I need to transfer movies from both the internal memory and an SD card, I have to connect the camera twice messing with that stupid setup menu to select recording media. It is a stupid waste of time. The video and still images are included in a single folder. This connects at USB 2 speeds - meaning it takes forever to transfer HD movies.<br /><br />I didn't mess with any Sony software for this camera. There was no disc included in the box, only a website to go download software. In fact there was no description of what software I could get there or why I might need it.<br /><br />There is a lot that I dislike about this camera. For the price, there are much better cameras with better ergonomics, better lenses, and easier to use. On the other hand, I haven't seen a camera with as wide a lens, and none of the others have a projector. If for some reason you absolutely have to have a projector on your camera, well this is the camera for you. When it comes down to it, this is more like a $250 camcorder that had a projector bolted on for an additional $150.	0
for a price this watch is really worth it i like the design and i thought i would be receiving something that i can laugh at but i guess i was wrong it is really a nice affordable watch.	1
If you treat it with care it will last a long time.  But I understand if people are not going to be careful with it they may think it is not really strong.	1
I just wish we had more &#34;Organic&#34; Libby's veggies. I think<br />I am ordering cases of whatever is being offered at this point<br />and look forward to more coming on the market.	1
My cousin just bought tubes. Its great and comes with consistent quality. II like the way it makes his bike look. I will probably be reordering these tubes when the ones I have need replacing.	1
If you like to do Kareoke and you have a playstation then this is ok. If not this is not for you. It is good for a few hours of entertainment and that is about all.	0
Exactly what have in the Starbucks store, and came with the needed pump. Recommend to everyone who likes Carmel flavoring.	0
I've used it on my toyota, a couple subaru outbacks, and a ford pickup. Works like a champ. Will display and reset codes.  For 20 bucks it's a no brainer	0
Read your labels, people!!! SMART bones are made in China!!!!!! A neighbor told me how great these were. After buying them, I read the fine print in the back. "Made in China!!"	0
Not much to say, the battery works fine, fits fine and seems to be perfect for the stinger flashlight. I have had it for a couple months now with no issues.	0
This is wonderful--easy to spot, snazzy and humerous. The tag is nice and bright,large ,seems sturdy and can be spotted from a mile away. It makes your luggage very easy to spot and I received great comments from people standing in line behind me. They all thought it's cool.	1
Was very happy with table, it is a little big but that is alright seats 6 people so it works out well.	0
This is an awesome deal and a must have for indoor bikers. It works great it serves its purpose just as intended. Th shipping was fantastic and I'm really satisfied.	1
Just bought another one of these for my grandpa. Very easy to use and shipped fast. Would recommend this product for a cheap way to adjust your watch.	1
Awesome product that exceeded my expectations. It works well and range is great with my phone, and the sound quality is great good base & treble sound. I like this Blue tooth Headphones.Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a Blue tooth headset!	1
I know this sounds really funny, but honestly, this is NOT for normal sized heads and definitely NOT for a child sized head.. I am an adult and this thing is just too big even at the shortest setting for me...	1
I'm not an audiophile, but I am a software engineer that listens to music for 8-14 hours every single day. I can't tell you the tiny details of tone quality at every single level, but honestly, if you're THAT concerned about perfect quality, why are you looking at $40 speakers? That's like Lance Armstrong finding his bike at Goodwill, come on.<br /><br />What I can tell you is that there's nothing offensive about these speakers. Sound is adjustable enough, and I have a huge variety of music. Hip hop sounds deep and good, metal has a clean crunch and perfect clarity in solos, classical pieces don't crack at all, it's easy to adjust dance/pop to not carry too much bass, etc. Also, these have done me plenty of good gaming (D3, LoL, etc.) I'd happily say the value is higher than the price.	0
This is an amazing collection with a lot of interesting bits that I’ve already seen but not in such great quality! The video and audio were all pitch perfect and nothing was out of line!	1
This waterproof iPod (by Swim Audio Electronics) has been a total game changer for me in the pool. Listening to music makes swimming a wonderful time and something to look forward to. The device clips easily on my goggles and the earphones that come with the bundle are as good as the company claims -they sound GREAT. Great purchase.	1
I was browsing to an item that has 3 dollars or less value then I stumbled into this item. It is cheap and is a great item and I did not know that it was really this useful, i can laugh cause this was really unexpected that i purchased an item that i though was worthless but turns out to be something very useful.	1
I have gotten a lot of this product from other sellers elsewhere but i keep getting disappointed every now and then, i came looking for this product on amazon and i was really glad the day i saw it and at a very good price. It really worked very well and its made of a high quality lightweight aluminium material,it fits well at once when i started using it and fuel passed through it very well.<br />Its a good product and i will recommend it to people who want to change their hose end fitting.	1
I like that the color is pure white, not yellow or blue like other lamps. Easily use it for desk and as a reading lamp in house. Looks super stylish  too!	1
Very pleasing color. Emits very little heat. The light is indistinguishable from an incandescent bulb when used inside a sconce or shade. I will be replace all my bulbs with these.	0
I thought I would go with a UA bag since their clothing line is pretty good quality. Well, this bag fell apart after 6 months of use. I will be writing them a letter telling them what a crap product they are selling. But hey, made in China. What do you expect right?	0
wondeful when you need to get something done but want to keep an eye on your mover and shaker! Reminds me of rug rats	1
Why I bought this is beyond me?? It is cheaply made with fish line type thread. There is no knotting between the beads. Worst though, is I haven't felt any relief for my arthritic hands either!	0
This water bottle is so great!!!! I am able to put any fruit in the infuser part of the bottle and it flavors my water with the fruit of my choice. I was surprised to find out that the fruit flavor lasted all day. This makes water much better to drink and I carry this bottle with me everywhere now. I am so happy that I ordered this product. I have been telling all my friends that they have to have one of these.	1
I kind of thought these were higher quality than they actually are. They are basically just like sunglasses you get in the checkout of a drug store.	1
This pump shaft is a good replacement part for machines that provide or dispense water, like wells, filters, and the like. The size is just perfect for all uses. I am loving this.	1
I finally got a chance to see this movie after seeing all the commercials for it. I figured though that the commercials held the best parts of the movie and I would not be impressed. If I could be any more wrong it would be impossible! Wow what a great movie! It is an absolutely hilarious Monster parody comedy all in one. Monsters afraid of Humans and Humans worshiping the monsters!<br /><br />The story is about Count Dracula holding up to his promise to protect his diseased wife and his daughter, Mavis. Count Dracula is deathly afraid of Humans and I will not spoil the why he is, but he is protecting Mavis from ever seeing them. He built a castle to keep her safe. Every year he invites all the monsters to his safe haven to celebrate Mavis's birthday. In the movie it is Mavis's (Selena Gomez's voice) 118th birthday, and she is ready to go out into the world and see things.<br /><br />After twists and turns and the Count trying to protect Mavis too much, Mavis finally meets a backpacking boy named Jonathan. Jonathan and her "Zing", and the rest I will leave up to the movie telling you what happens. It truly is a very funny and interesting movie.<br /><br />The comedy in this movie is very good not only for children, but adults too. I was very pleasantly surprised to see how good this movie is. It was one of the better animated movies I have seen in the past few months, and I will be watching it again.<br /><br />Overall I would highly recommend seeing this movie!	0
Yes, it's flimsy. Very flimsy, as a matter of fact. But it still does what its supposed to do so I don't really care about the quality. I mean, it's very cheap...I didn't expect too much.	1
I love this sequel.  It is one of the few sequels that measures up to the first.  Batman is still a very conflicted guy.  Then Selena Kyle is a mild wimpy secretary who knows a little self-defense.  After she gets pushed out of a window, saved by some cats she becomes changed and the secret part of her that was hidden away comes out to play.  The Penguin is a slightly sympathetic but in general evil and sadistic.  I love Michelle Pfeiffer's portrayal of Catwoman.  She is both a good guy and a bad guy and not very manipulative.  I love because she is a complete b**ch, but in a good way.  No one pushes her around and those that do she gets even with.  Although she and Batman do start a relationship she can't deny who she truly is and she would rather be that than be with him.  The Penguin gets his comeuppance.  Selena gets even with Max who pushed her out of the window. Batman aka Bruce knows at the end that she is still roaming the streets and he can count her to be an ally as long as he doesn't get in her way!	0
Easy to hang and install. The screen works perfectly for my projector and I like that I can retract it so it is easily hidden.	0
They are great! They are about the size of a quarter and surprisingly bright. Perfect for camping and music festivals. I am very pleased with them.	1
I bought this as a present for my boyfriend- he is a visual merchandiser at a suit store, and has to dress well and look really good at work. He LOVES this pocket watch, and so do all of his coworkers. It looks and feels very sturdy and good, and it makes such a satisfying sound when he winds it. It's become his signature piece and a lot of his clients now even know him as 'the guy with the pocket watch.' I definitely recommend!	0
Handy thing to have when traveling...Get it you will love it...It came in handy when i went on vacation...Great charger to own....	0
This looks very good. I did not give it 5 stars is because the instructions are inaccurate which is a little frustrating. However, it does not take too much effort to work out what to do. The only other thing I would change is the fact that it has gold dials in it and then the hands are gold which makes it a little difficult to read in certain lighting conditions. Otherwise, I love it.	1
The design is smart, they are very spacious, but the cardboard only goes halfway on each shelf which is weird and makes it not appear as strong as things in the back sag.  The side pockets seemed like a good idea, but I can't use them because I am using them with other closet organizers.  I like that it velcros over the rod, makes it easy to customize the fit and move around easily.	0
I am a fan of the Resident Evil franchise, and with this game, I became more loyal to the franchise. Great graphics, great game control and creepy looking zombies with tentacles makes this game a lot more exhilarating and exciting to play! Chris Redfield is back with this installment, and also a newcomer, Sheva Alomar. Together they will help each other survive the horrors of Africa.	1
I don't like how it looks. It looks so disgusting. but my cat loves it. Moyi because fat after taking this and I think she love it so much. She can finish a bowl even for few seconds. I won't be surprised of she became so fat. I would really laugh to see her having  a hard time walking. Now, she would be like me. Oh, I am just kidding. I don't want her to be so fat. But I won't stop feeding her this because she loves it, again.	1
I currently have hundreds of coffee pods trying to find the best.  Finally!  This is without a doubt the very best!  If you like full-bodied, flavorful coffee without the bitter after taste, this is it!  I can even make it at the highest water level and it's still delicious.  Thank you Green Mountain!	0
Excellent product with the great performance.They help my radiator keep my current set up cool.Plus, they have a lifetime warranty against any damage to the hose.This is a great product, installed perfectly and looks great .It works perfect...It really worths.Can't go wrong with Honda Civic radiator and silicone hoses, they'll outlast the car!	1
What else can you say but it's 560 pieces of Legos! They're awesome, providing hours of play and our toddler loves them.	0
For those of you who know, the Peak by devicewear is a "Wedge" style case. It is name this way because you can use the wedge shape that it makes to put it in either a horizontal, landscape or any other way you want it. I like this style of case because you get the most sturdy stand and don't have to worry about the case. I also like this style because I like to type small notes and the typing mode makes that really easy. I also like the way the ipad looks like it's framed in by the case. The stitching really is done well and makes the case stand out. I recommend this case highly to everyone I talk to and think it is a really great case.	1
First I'd like to say that if you pick up some of these it'll make your life easier :D http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0019EHU8G?tag=007p-20  This is a excellent soundbar great sound and bass. Easy to set up and navigate. Pros: 1) Excellent customer service 2) Room filling sound 3) Excellent bass 4) Attractive profile 5) Easy bluetooth Cons: 1) No treble adjustment 2) No memory for each listening mode 3) No HDMI inputs for uncompressed audio formats such as DTS HD or DD plus 4) No HDMI ARC for controlling volume with the televisions remote. Just another remote to use and have family members bitch.  I was looking for something with great sound To replace my surround sound system which just takes up to much room. I got what I wanted with this sound bar and wireless sub. Paring the bar and sub was very fast and simple to do after that I just connected the bar to my tv and everything was ready to go. I don't miss my surround sound this bar is far better and much easier to use. Sound is clear and powerful rather it be from the tv or from my phone with the Bluetooth connection.  In short you should really pick up the http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TKPAWFO?tag=007p-20	1
This is an awesome baby monitor IF you keep it plugged in constantly, it doesn't last very long off the charger and if you shut it off the monitor, you may as well just plug it in cuz if you turn it back on, it's dead. But sound quality and everything is wonderful.	1
These earrings are well matched in colour and in size.  The reason for the 3 rating is because they don't state that these are 'button' pearls, which these definitely are.  They are not round, but instead, quite flat.  I happen to like button pearls BUT if that's what I wanted, I would have ordered that.  So, for this reason, these pancake shaped earrings only earned a 3 star review, in my humble opinion.  But the final decision is up to you.	0
Our new baby mixed bunny likes this. She nibbles on it and lays partly in, partly out of it very contentedly. It will quickly outgrow her, but she did hop right in, groom herself, and then flop down for a nap. So she says at least 4 stars. ;)	0
LIfe is random ! There is no rhyme or reason for the good to be loaded down with bad luck and the immoral rewarded.  There is added humor to this film plus a plot to murder. Another Woody Allen KEEPER !!!	0
Arrived quickly and expertly packaged. Very easy to use. I started using it right out of the box. I am having a lot of fun with it. The instructions could use some work, but it was still pretty simple to figure out :)	0
a bit pricey for the quality but it organizes my little things perfectly. And the plastics quite durable. So 4 stars it is!	1
The color blue of the shoe is really bright, like cobalt blue, & the mesh area is white mesh over grey material, so I hope they won't look so dirty when they get older like other white shoes do.  Can't complain about the comfort, they are Asics after all!	0
I bought this ring because my fiancé wanted a sturdy ring with some black. This ring is poor quality, feels like its plastic and wouldn't last a minute without scratching on any guy's hand.	1
I am assuming the product works as I have no way to actually test it.  It arrived in good time and in good condition.	0
I bought the uke for theme night at a local bar for laughs more than anything else but since i'v had it it sounds decent and keeps tune. It's fun to goof off with and better built than i thought.	1
Superb for holding our medium-weight rug to the floor, love it! Seriously, wife and I both tried to do the "Tom Cruise slide" (ala Risky Business, remember that one?) on the rug and nodda, no budging to be had - awesome!    Just got it so, will come back and update later if anything changes though I highly doubt it will. I will say that I'm at least mildly concerned about any of this type of pad leaving permanent waffle marks on the finish of the wood, but we figured it didn't much matter since we bought the house recently and the floor is already in fair to partly cloudy shape as far as needing refinishing anyway.    *** Update -- One month later and, still no sliding - YEAH!!! ***	0
It looks fine  on the phone and it is easy to remove. I would trust to to protect against falls, but to help reduce small dings while it sits on my desk, rides in my car, or is carried in my pocket to keep out dust and lint, then yes, it is good for that.	1
The Monster Rancher Saga paired with mobility is the best thing you could ask for from UFO. I've had so much fun trying to raise all the different monsters, and pairing them trying to see which ones would combine in the right ways. My only complaint is that I wish there were maybe one or two other options of stuff to do with your monster. Other than that, it's a great time to be had. It's a good place to start with the series, and easy to just jump into. Whether you've played all of the Monster Rancher games, or none of them, this is a great purchase.	0
The fresh taste water bottle is the best bottle ever. Its appearance not only makes a statement, but also is very practical. The makers of this product knew what they were doing. I really liked the handle. I can carry it anywhere with me. VERY durable. I enjoy using my bottle all the time.	1
We've all read the horror stories (thanks Facebook) about children being injured or killed by household objects tumbling on top of them. I somehow raised two children without anything happening, but with our youngest now learning how to pull himself up, I was terrified something might happen. I wasn't quite sure what we could do other than maybe wrap everything in bubble wrap and get rid of anything over 3 feet tall. Fortunately Dreambaby® was a step ahead of me. The products were easy to install and have given me peace of mind. As I watch my son creep and crawl around the room, I know when he pulls himself up he will be safe. Thanks Dreambaby® - Definitely 5 stars in my books - and absolutely priceless!	0
I bought this along with the Zumba core after using the original one. The graphics are excellent, quite an effective upgrade.	0
Looks great in the box. Kitchen remodel underway looking forward to having a kitchen and a kitchen sink. We are switching from a double bowel to a single bowel sink.	0
ALTHOUGH THIS IS ADVERTISED AS A COMPOST BIN MOISTURE METER, WE USE IT FOR OUR HOUSEPLANTS AND GARDEN SOIL. THE UNIT WAS INEXPENSIVE BUT DOES THE JOB. DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS UNDERWATERING SOME OF MY HOUSEPLANTS. COULDN'T BE HAPPIER WITH THE PURCHASE.	0
This is a poor quality product. I suggest that don't buy this product. One out of five cables worked. Enough said.	1
This portable DVD player has a beautiful picture, excellent sound quality (I used earphones), is very easy to operate and has all the features I wanted.	1
Nate Mendel is one of the most underrated bass players out there. I think he's even better than Geddy Lee or John Myung. His bass sounds so full and has its own sound palette. Did I forget to mention that the bass looks gorgeous?	1
I like this one however there is another bold coffee with a tiger on the k-cup that is slightly better	0
Great quality water bottle , convienient for traveling ! Super space saver , love this! Highly recommended!	1
All get great signal strength. It never drops below 45%, and is enough to maintain a 54Mbps data rate using 802.11g cards. It's all about the signal strength, and the D-Link delivers.	1
Perfect for what we needed, sturdy and comfortable for working at the computer without making my house look like an office. The casters are hard to get on as noted.	1
Would not call it a &#34;miracle&#34; litter catcher but better than several other options I've tried and sweeps/cleans nicely. It does the trick.	0
I have been looking for something to replace having to use so many pads while I am on my menstrual cycle. I got these and they are great! The first thing that I noticed was that they are very convenient to carry around due to the way they fold up. They fit easily into my purse for when I am on the go. It has a really soft feel to it! A problem I have with pads is that I have allergic reactions down there so I have to be very careful. These did not break me out and are so easy to use. I clip it on and it stays in place. When I am done I fold it up and then throw it in the wash when I am home. The reusable pads do not let it leak and come in handy. I was offered this as a promotion for my honest opinion.	1
Even though these were made for bigger calves, I still could not wear them. I could not get the buckle to size the boot to fit my legs. Oh well. They were probably a bit tall for me anyway. But had they fit, I would have kept them just to have some black boots.	1
These pads provide total protection for my knees.  They are uncommonly light, low cost, simple and effective. No gimmicks, just performance.  Unlike some others, mine fit the way they should.	0
I really liked this cartilage earring when it arrived and was very excited to wear something different in my ear, but the diamonds fell out with in days of wearing very disappointing.	0
Poorly made and ripped only mins after my kid put it on. Also the tail hook is rather flimsy, I had to use Velcro dots just for the tail to stay up like it is supposed to.	0
Only complaint is what feels like a micro-level of flash across the scalp as I cut my hair low.  Low level clippers should probably be the last with this problem out of the mfr's door.  Lifelong Andis user, though...I'd buy it again.	0
I‘m very fond of wearing bracelets. I keep on purchasing different types of bracelets. So, I also decided this one too. It is affordable and fashionable. I am very pleased with this purchase as I got it on time and in perfect condition.	1
We were a little concerned when we pulled the mattress out of the box and it was vacuum sealed to a few inches thick, but as soon as we broke the seal - it expanded to nearly full size almost immediately. By morning, it was all set.  Very comfortable mattress and exactly what we needed.	0
Works on Cluster Flies! The first &#34;Tennis racket of Death&#34; that was sent to me was defective. It happens. The company then sent a replacement but it was an AA model and not the one I ordered which was the C cell. I bought an older farmhouse and needed this for the bugs that are there. Which at this time of year consist of Cluster Flies and Asian Lady Beetles. The AA model took like 6 hits to kill a cluster fly. Sometimes they would drop on the ground and get up fairly quickly. Asian Lady Beetle which sort of look like a ladybug but aren't, tnded to die after being zapped a couple of times.<br />Once the C cell model arrived Cluster flies would die in 1-2 zaps and ALB's would die with one hit. If you've never dealt with either of these pests they are super annoying and can get into the tiniest of spaces. Cluster flies will ply dead by laying on their backs and hide in cracks so tiny you can't figure out how they fit. Lady beetles are worse. When the light and heat comes on these bugs come out in force and both will bite. I fully expected these bugs to explode like popcorn but they are super tough as well as clever. They will walk rather than fly. No idea how this will work on wasps or hornets but will find out in the spring.<br />If you want something that kills quick you really need the bigger model. For stuff like spiders and mosquitos the AA model should work well. For hardier insects get the C cell model you will need it.<br />also be very careful if you go after web spiders. The webs can make contact with the electrical contacts and it will pop and zap as if it were a bug on it. The product works well and as advertised but some bugs are tougher to kill than others and you really shouldn't kill Asian lady beetles with this because they stink pretty bad when they pop from being zapped. I accidentally killed a stink bug with this and whoo wee! did it ever smell. Lady beetles aren't as bad but they do reek when they die.	0
MINWAX Wood Cleaner is the ONLY wood cleaning product that I will use on our wooden furniture, including our wood cabinets in our kitchen and in our bathroom. This AMAZING product is gentle on wood, while cleaning it to perfection. My husband and I, love this product because it does not leave a waxy build up.  It is the BEST wood cleaner around. I have tried other products before discovering MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and there is no turning back. This 'magical' cleaner should not be a secret! I could not find MINWAX WOOD CLEANER in Canada, so I ordered two (2) cases of it online, from the United States. When it arrived to our home, I was happier than a child who had just recieved a present in the mail, of toys and penny candy.  I have squirreled away bottles of this incredible product, so that I am not without. I cannot say enough about MINWAX WOOD CLEANER because first of all the trigger spray bottle is user friendly and the rippled  sides of the bottle are super-easy to grip. The design of the bottle is intelligent, because your fingers easily wrap around the trigger spray bottle, making it a charm to use.  The contents, inside the bottle...the wood cleaner is something that needs to be highly advertised because this really is the cream of the crop product, for cleaning your wood. Wooden furniture and wooden cabinets are expensive and this product takes excellent care of one's wood. I do not like products that leaves a waxy, shinny, artificially coated build up that wrecks the wood. MINWAX lubricates all types of  wood and it really provides a RED CARPET feeling with regards to wood cleaning!!! Great products means great results and this is what MINWAX WOOD CLEANER IS ALL ABOUT.  MINWAX does NOT leave a coated film of any kind, which is SO VERY IMPORTANT.  I only want the best for my wood....MINWAX FLOOR CLEANER IS THE BEST PRODUCT FOR MY WOOD and I ONLY use MINWAX WOOD CLEANER and will NEVER use another brand.  I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!!!!	0
i ordered this black leather flat shoe and they never disappointed me size the size was ok and also are very comfy to walk with.	1
I am in love with these! They are great to use on flip charts as well. I write on these to highlight what I am trying to teach and then I attach them to my anchor charts and laminate them! Beautiful colors	0
The screen does not show up clear and its dim. The screen is only visible in complete darkness. These screen protectors are not good for everyday use... THEY SUCK!!	0
Only used them once so far, but they worked like a charm. It's great to be able to walk on ice w/o worrying about slipping.	0
I got a few exercise DVDs not to get bored with the same routine and to do exercises at home since I do not have time for the Gym. This DVD is exactly what I needed.<br />It is not long I am done in 30 minutes. There is a full body  exercise routine which works out all my body parts.<br />I use 8 Lb dumbbells. The exercises are very clearly explained and shown. The camera work is great showing the exercise form many different angles making it very easy to do the exercises correctly.<br />Recommended to those who want a no nonsense simple fast exercise routine.	1
I bought this about a year ago.  Works very well and definitely solid construction.  I doubt it will break even with daily use. It's actually a Hi Hat pedal so wont have the same action as a real mallet type but a major upgrade over the OEM item. Only thing that stands out to me is I got it for $30.00 and now it's $80.00???  That's some serious inflation.  May want to look elsewhere, like maybe an auction site, for a better price.	0
My wife wears this next to her 25th Anniversary ring and they truly compliment each other.  She loves it ... and I'm happy.	0
Hello!<br /><br />I just got home from work and my light has arrived.  I wanted a light that was versatile. I ride my bike to work so I wanted my bike light to be a flashlight as well.<br /><br />My wife and I walked to the corner store to give the light a try. The battery was not fully charged, but I had no issues with brightness.<br /><br />I use the 18650 batteries in my vape  device. I always have two with me. With the battery that was included, I have plenty of light.<br /><br />The tail light was a nice bonus.<br /><br />Overall I love the light. The different modes will be great for camping. I got a great multipurpose light for a bargain price! Batteries alone cost 1/3 the price of the light. The mounts for my bike and the tail light would cost another 20. Wow.... We reached the price of the light before it was added to the equation.<br /><br />Thanks for a great product..	0
First off I want to say I love them and am very happy with the purchase. I got the 4mm in stainless set. I can even see buying the gold 4mm set as well in the future. The colors are lovely and the stones are large enough to really show the color. The packaging was small sterile piercing packs so if you are using them to actually pierce your or somebody 's ears then that might matter to you. I didn't get these for piercing, only for my own use as regular earrings.<br /><br />These have large posts and I knew that from other reviews before buying. I have ears that want to close up fairly fast so that didn't bug me. I actually wanted the larger posts to help stretch my tiny holes just a bit. However they are large posts and that might be a problem for some. For those unfamiliar gauge numbers, they get smaller as the size gets bigger. I used a caliper to measure the earrings I was pierced with and those are a 20 gauge. 18 to 20 gauge are typically used for most regular earrings. These measure out very close to a 16 gauge. Perhaps just a bit smaller like a 17 gauge? They are a bit tight for me going in and probably will be for most people who don't have their ear piercings stretched. They will fit but just be aware that it is bigger then most posts. These earring posts are just big enough to cause me a touch of discomfort and a speck of blood from getting them in. I am hoping to get my holes to this size because my ears just want to close.<br /><br />The only other thing I feel I should mention is that the posts seem to be the same actual length as most of my other earrings however...These earrings don't fit like others because of the thicker posts. It feels shorter on the ear. Now I have fairly thin earlobes and these do feel fine but because of the thicker post the post feels shorter as well. Like I said its pretty much the same length post as almost all the others I have. It just feels shorter.<br /><br />Here is my take on these.<br /><br />If you have thick earlobesthese probably won't work for you.<br />If you have tiny holes then these might feel uncomfortable going in. Even cause a touch of bleeding.<br /><br />If you have holes that are a bit stretched already then these might fit better then regular 18 or 20gauge.<br />If you have have tiny holes that want to close up fast then these might give you the right amount of stretch to your holes to open them up a bit but keep in mind you should treat your ears as re-pierced for awhile till they have a chance to get used to being this size.	0
I bought this for my 10 year old son and he absolutely loved it. The controller is easy to use and the helicopter flies pretty high. My son uses this in the backyard and takes it to go camping and the beach. The toy is extremely durable and portable. It has a light that flashes and the battery life is pretty long. My son couldn't be any happier with this toy. In fact, my husband plays with it as well. Shipping was fast and I plan on buying one more for my nephew for his upcoming birthday	1
The light is really bulky. I had a hard time finding a place for it on my kindle that wouldn't block the screen. I had to put it at an angle for it to not block anything because if I tried to just attach it a little higher up it kept slipping. It also broke really easily, somehow the flexible part got twisted too much and now the wires are exposed. I would not buy this again because I think I'll probably be able to find better reading lights.<br /><br />This one is just not ideal for books or kindles and is somewhat fragile.	0
I have been using these for several months now and find they do nothing whatsoever to reduce static. At first I tried using just 4.Then I added the second set of 4, no difference. They may help speed drying time a little bit, not a lot. In addition, they get tangled up in sleeves, sheets and are a nuisance to look for. Overall, sorry I purchased them.	0
my so love trombone and so i purchased this one for him,bought it because it is made of plastic and  also it is small for her to handle.when it arrived i was so happy to find that the mouth piece is small and that he can not struggle himself to use it.	1
For the price you sure can't beat it. I bought it for my new puppy who was shivering all the time. He looks very dapper in his red sweater!	0
These are great little snacks. I love having these when I'm in the mood for something sweet. They aren't too big either so they can easily be carried in a purse or pocket. They are the best for snacking or making caramel apples!	1
This vitamin seems great so far.  Has lots of needed vitamins for every dog.  I give 4 stars because they would be better in maybe a plastic jar instead of resealable bag. Also while 2 of my dogs love them.  One sniffs and refuses to touch it at all. Overall great dog vitamin!	1
Either I really don't know what I'm looking for or this thing doesn't really make much of a difference for me.	1
I use this expandable shelf in my pantry.  So much better than those rubber ones.  I also have one in my cabinet for my favorite set of dishes.	0
I find that the older I get, the harder it is to lose weight....but I've gotten great results taking garcinia this month. I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time.	1
Great keychain. We bought our son a used X5 for Christmas and we wrapped this keychain with the key. Great quality, sure to please.	1
This is exactly the package shown with LTI, Alpha, Beta etc shows up in the Hangar right away and looks beautiful.	1
This is such a cute puppy. I am a little disappointed that it doesn't or can't relax a bit without just being powered off. I thought the barking and all the sounds it makes was cute, but the non stop spinning and jumping and spinning some more is almost to much.	1
I've never felt compelled to submit a product review before but This Jump Box far exceeds my expectations. I've used it commercially and jumped 1 or 2 cars with no problems . Actually i bought this Jump box for son who have  A Car with old dead battery and the car had been sitting about 4 week and you know how hard it is to start a car with a dead battery that has been sitting , finally i used this awesome jump box with battery  am really wonder its like car got new life . its really awesome one . i already recommended to my cousin who using heavy truck for travel miles am pretty sure its useful for him . Highly recommended one and really worth for money	1
I really enjoy playing this game with my little son. I do work hard to avoid any type of conflict (don't want him to see that) and just drive or fly around in this unbelievably large, multi-faceted open world; it is a very beautiful game. We love the vehicles; planes, tanks, helicopters, bikes, cars etc. The graphics are generally good and very believable and the art direction in this game is top notch.	1
Buy it. Simple, user friendly. Easy online instructions. It is just that easy, the sliding back strap is awesome and easy to switch between dad and mom.	0
The umbrella functions well and it does provide the shade I was looking for. I didn't like the stand as it was intrusive and would require an individual to walk around and avoid it. I bolted it into our cement patio. Had that not been done, an umbrella that sits in the center would have sufficed.	1
This tray fit perfectly on my folding walker.  It was very easy to slide right onto the upright arms and it is really handy to have.  When not in use, it flips back and out of the way.  Thank you Nova Ortho-Med for this super aid for my walker.	0
First one I have owned so cant compare to anything but it works great and splits some logs that are 20&#34; thick. Its fun to use and easy to move with the wheels.	0
I hate the product. It is very bad product not great quality.  I purchased the product for my daughter 1 month ago and my daughter not pleased used the product. She tried using it again with a non-rubber pacifier. Same thing. Weird smell that caused my daughter to reject her pacifier. Save yourself the trouble and ruined pacifiers and buy another brand.<br />I would tell anyone purchase it. I always hate the product.	1
Great product from a great company. I bought this product along with several other items from the same company to make my own pre-workout and post-workout recovery drinks. After using their products for months, I can say they are of great quality, and the value is unmatched. Not only am I saving an immense amount of money on supplements, but I am sure the products I take are pure and without additives (Most supplement companies are very misleading about the amount of each substance they add to their products. They group together substances that may have a synergistic effect at achieving a specified goal, give that group of substances a catchy name, and label the total amount of that particular blend of supplements without specifying the exact amount of each particular substance. i.e. &#34;proprietary energy and focus blend&#34; & &#34;muscle cell volumizing matrix&#34;) Save yourself some money and be sure you're taking the recommended doses of all your supplements by acquiring them individually from a reliable company, and mixing them yourself!	0
.This is amazing on those hot humid days. It also really helps remove the unbearable weather. This fan has an easy setup and the instructions are very well detailed and step by step. . It works really well and I love that it is a piece of cake to turn on and off and to store away in the winter.	1
I bought this for my honeymoon. I was afraid it wasn't going to be in ontime. I contacted the seller they got back to me right away and assured me it would be in ontime and it was : ) The bathing suit is really cute. Runs small make sure you get the next size up then what you would normally wear.	0
This was on my checklist for quite awhile now, I finally got purchasing one after feeling sorry for myself at the sight of my withered Girbaud bifold. I feel leveled up with my new TH wallet, nothing jazzy with the wallet, just a well built leather one, with a very neat and imposing Tommy Hilfiger branding in front.	1
My 6 year old son loves this watch. He wants to wear it all the time. The face is only about the size of a quarter, so it is proportionally right for a kid.<br /><br />The latch on it is just two pieces of plastic that slide into each other, and it unlatches somewhat easily.<br /><br />It comes with extra links to get the fit right, and a different face-plate ring to make it look more lego-y.	0
I purchased this for my little man who wears various color of dress pants. This belt fits the bill and switching from one color to the other is literally a snap! And of course, there price can't be beat!	1
Nice watch but the band broke after a few months of having it. Also the back is clear in between the dials just in case you dont know what transparency mean.	0
Great for light rain, but not on windy days. It looks great and the design is perfect for minimal splashback. But for light rain, this is perfect.	1
This is a nice mirror with a great design. Before getting it, I was wondering if it would be a good quality for the price I paid, however I was not disappointed.  It looks better than in pictures.I would definitely recommend this mirror to everyone who is still thinking of buying one.	1
I did a lot of searching before settling on this bag. It's made of beautiful sturdy leather which also smells great. It's just the right size - the step is plenty long and I've had lots of compliments already.	1
I really like Atra type blades and my Atra razor was old and the mechanism that holds the razor blades in place was worn out so I wanted to find a replacement. I guess Gillette quit making the Atra razor because I could not find one anywhere. I saw this Atra compatible Razor and gave it a try.<br /><br />I am happy with purchase	0
Easy to install, SUPER BRIGHT light! This light is very noticeable and my bike and I are noticed much more often. Always a plus! I am still using the original batteries after 250 miles. So far, GREAT LIGHT!	1
This would be a great suitcase if you were never going to fly with it just used it for car trips. It has a warranty but Im not even going to waste my time fixing it because I know it will happen again. Ill use the smaller pieces in the set for car trips and carry on.	1
The bag has more room than picture shows. Great for carrying snorkeling gear and towels to the beach. Great color.	0
I must say I just god this, and is very comfortable, The mattress set seems very durable and was a great price,  is just what I needed to get that comfortable sleep , It was hard to decide what mattress we wanted, but after we choose this one, It got shipped after 3 days , so I'm​ pretty happy.I fully recomand this	1
I have only had this item about 18 hours. There was some initial problem with the supplied HDMI cable during set up. I could see the indicator on the main unit blink but there was no picture. After screwing around for about 30 minutes I changed the cable and I was in business!! Yes I keep one around just for that reason..<br /><br />Network set up on my wired network was automatic and did not require me to intervene. It looks as though a static address could be set if it was desired.<br /><br />I spent some time playing with set up so I was familiar with the menu flow. Then streamed a movie from Amazon Prime!!<br /><br />This should be a sweet device!! It downloads the control codes for your cable box, satellite dish and television and many other devices and gives control of them all. I installed and configured an app to view my networked security cameras. Keyboard, mouse, web browser and Android apps. Keyboard controls for most of the necessary functions of attached devices.<br /><br />I'll update the review if there are any problems longer term.<br />2013_02_27<br /><br />Long term downloading became a problem and playing streaming videos got to be tough. The "aw snap" the "" plugin has encountered a problem is WAY TO COMMON. On top of that I believe it was already obsolete when I bought it. No updating of the OS seems to happen. The plug in crash is a known problem and I have been able to make none of the work arounds happen. The fan grinds along 24/7 and is becoming loud enough to be "very" annoying.<br /><br />2013_05_20<br /><br />Ok so I have finally tired of the constant crashes of the plugins for streaming video from Amazon. After the latest update the video from Amazon would not stream at all. Since I'm a Prime member that would be really nice to have. Looks like an ongoing problem between Flash and Chrome. Who knows.. Pulled the top off and blew out the fan to no avail.<br /><br />I bought a ROKU and it's working out of the box. No hassle, no crashing, nofan.	0
Loved it! It was totally worth the investment! Mark showed the real struggle of someone with a terrible disease and his soul is helping lots currently going through similar problems!	0
I grew up with classic chili - spicy, not too wet. A substance of its own. A stand-alone easy dinner treat.<br /><br />One winter evening my wife and I went out for dinner and decided to pay a visit to a Hard Times Chili parlor. Imagine my surprise when I opened the menu to find three different types of chili. I'm thinking &#34;really, how different can chili recipes be?&#34; I decided to ask our waitress about the differences and she told me about Cincinnati style. The difference being the cinnamon added to the batch.<br /><br />I was so pleased that I tried this style - I LOVE cinnamon. It is one of my favorite spices. So, I dug in with some fresh cornbread and a cold beer and was so pleasantly surprised - I now had a new favorite chili recipe. The problem arose when we moved to a new location and there were no Hard Times cafes in our neighborhood. So I began the hunt for a Cincinnati style chili mix that was as good as Hard Times. After scouring Amazon for other reviews I decided to take a chance on this particular brand. It is SPOT ON to my experience at Hard Times and is a great price. We have made only a small change to the preparation instructions that are supplied with the packets - we cut the amount of water that they recommend adding to the mix by almost half and now have the same taste and consistency that we loved at Hard Times.	0
I haven't tried this yet since my friend gave it to me, but when I put some on a hot coal bed, the smell was intoxicating. If I find the time to smoke some meats, I will definitely use these chunks.	1
My little guy is now 2.5 years old, and these toys have been a bath time companion for the past 6-7 months. He absolutely loves them, and his favorite is the blue one. They are a great size for his small hands.	1
These clogs have a better fit than most. I'm able to actually walk in them, not shuffle. They are very good.	0
love the watch but hate the band- too small- just read that the band cannot be replaced as it is part of the watch-will give to my grandson and buy local next time for hands on	0
Very nice bright and not too big not too small, comfortable while wearing and great to sleep with. super cute earring set	1
Works just like a brand new drum. Very happy with the purchase and will be ordering morew for sure. thanks	1
My cat loves... LOVES... these balls. I do not so much love them. He likes to play with them in the early hours before the sun comes up and the little bell has a way of waking me. But cats LOVE these balls.	1
It is okay not small not super huge.  Jelly is fairly soft with no weird odors or smells.  However only has adjustable speed setting if had the 10 choices like others I would possible consider this a 4 star or 5 star. Vibrations pretty strong for the size of the items and its hardware.	0
Looks Great but had small chips and small glaze out of box but amazon return policy is great. Small but visually very nice, color changing LEDs a great touch Got a replacement quickly and no defects and very pleased. Will buy again.	0
I love the size, the fit, the support. Everything except that the soles are made in such a way that they squuk loudly. Everyone at the gym laughs when they hear me coming! I am going to have to use them outdoors only from now on.	1
Reusable spray bottle - i use it for more than just marinade for the bbq. Mix up salad dressings and all kinds of things in this bottle.	1
Good monitor for the price. Met all my expectations. I like the glossy display because videos and movies look more crisp than matte.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Would have been nice to have a display port. Speakers suck as all monitor speakers do. Why do they bother putting them in? No one ever uses them.<br /><br />Overall, happy with the purchase. It was delivered safe and quickly.	0
This picture is so beautiful and it has an inner glow that makes you think that you are viewing it from within the trees. I would highly recommend this to anyone. I will be buying others very soon! I don't think you will be disappointed.	1
I bought 2 of them, and my 4 and 5 yr old granddaughters can't put them down.  It is great to give them something that helps them learn and entertains them at the same time.	0
“My dog has allergies and some bad hot spots and this Anti-Itch Shampoo has really helped him heal. This shampoo really works!!	1
These cubes are so awesome. I bought them because I needed new ones to take with me on my summer vacation this year. They can hold tons of stuff for me and my family. I was able to pack everything and organize it well with these cubes.	1
This pillow is really very nice i was looking like this from a long time and finally founded it on amazon. it's very comfortable and soft.i am very happy with this and thinking to buy in future . If you are looking a pillow you are at right place must give it a try you will like it .	1
First of all, this is a beautiful guitar!  Great finish, beautiful wood, well made.  It's got very good tone, and plays easy right out of the box.  I also have a Gibson J-45, so I've got something to compare it to.  No, it doesn't sound as good as the Gibson, but for around $350, I wasn't expecting it to.  I bought this guitar because I wanted something different from my dreadnaught, and to have something that I didn't have to humidify.  I had one problem.  There was a buzz on the top string at the 12th fret.  Fortunately for me, I have a friend who is a luthier, and after some work to the frets, it sounds great!  Also I wasn't a fan of the stock strings, so I changed them out for my favorites (Elixir nano-webs), and found it playing better after that as well.  In short, beautiful guitar, especially for the money, very good tone, but may need some work to get it right.  Amazon has an easy return policy, so it would even be worth sending one back to get the next one right, if necessary.	0
not good for long and steady applications, go for another brand... i wouldnt ever use this product again... looking for a better one	0
What can I say. I am very happy with Edwin Jagger, the faux ivory handle goes extremely well and has a nice finish to it. It weighs decently on my hand and made me feel manly when I use it. Combine with a good shaving soap this made my shaving experience enjoyable than the plastic disposable and the processed s*** than comes out of a can. The product itself was very reasonably priced but I did pay a lot for shipping to my country. Overall i'm extremely happy and would not hesitate to purchase this again if it needs to be replaced :)	0
Love this bag, it looks great! I use it every day when I go to work, and even my colleagues said that it looks astonishing! The retro design and the natural way it looks it simply great, especially for this fair and reasonable price...five stars!	1
This watch is so gorgeous! The pictures do not do it justice. When it came I was amazed at the quality for under $50. The crystals on the face look like huge diamonds and are so sparkly. This won't be my last Wristology watch!	1
There was a time, not too long ago, when Gold Toe made the best socks that money could buy. They were twice or even three times as expensive as the competition, but considering that a pair could be washed and used thirty times or more before wearing out, they were still the best deal in town. Buying 12 pairs at a time, all looking the same of course, would set me for a year.<br /><br />Then a few years ago I noticed something had happened. Gold Toe had become strangely affordable, only somewhat more expensive than the generic brands. The next thing I noticed was after a couple of washes, some of them had shrunk, others had holes in them, and within short just about all of them had worn out. Being a long time Gold Toe fan, i hoped it was just a bad batch, so gave them one more chance. Same thing. I am guessing Gold Toe has, like so many other companies, fired their workers and are simply slapping their label on production runs from the same sweat shops that make the regular generic wear and dispose clothing.<br /><br />I no longer buy Gold Toe as I see little reason to pay extra without getting anything extra. If someone could recommend a quality sock maker still in business I am all ears.	0
From my teen years to my adulthood I have suffered from wrinkles on my face. I didn't know the reason of it but it really disgusted me when I looked in the mirror. I'm in my early 30's and my face looked more like of a 55 year old. I needed immediate assistance and luckily I stumbled across this Botox alternative acid and to be honest, I've never felt more confident in myself. My deep wrinkles are barely noticeable and I've only been using this for a short time. Can't wait some more time to pass and I'll finally look how I wanted to.	1
I was fortunate to attend Stephanie's first book signing where I purchased my copy of "Ride On! As I waited in line, I watched her personal video playing on the table.Each picture in the slideshow depicted Stephanie and Chris happy, in love and clearly showed their passion for riding bikes. "What a beautiful couple they are," I thought to myself as I viewed wedding pictures,the honeymoon, and simply "living and loving life." I thumbed through the book and immediately found more pictures inserted which sadly depicted Chris in the midst of his illness. Even then, he wore a smile and always had "thumbs up!" I could not wait to go home and start reading!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to readers. It is a wonderful love story, yes, but also a story of hope, perseverance and a strong faith and belief in a Higher Power.This book has made me a better person and an extremely grateful one.	0
Not happy...always had success with prior Overstock orders. Although I ordered according to my dog's weight as recommended, this tank would be very tight on my little puggle. When I attempted to return the item following the printed instructions included, I was unable, as it said the item is INELIGIBLE for return...now I'm stuck with a cute little dog top we can't even use!	1
It does not tip over even with laptop made for the first top zipper instead of near the handle.The back does pull in on the sides and bend around the handle when fully loaded and standing upright. This is a problem I have found with all roller bags though so I am not surprised.	0
Great product but not exactly the size I thought.  All on me though.  I should have read better.  Still looking for my smaller ones.  They are used though on a different rack so still a good deal.	0
Overall, this cover does what it is supposed to do: it protects your iPod's screen and reduces the glare - in my case it helps stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprints.  This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either.<br /><br />Before you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod!<br /><br />2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.<br /><br />3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again.<br /><br />Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!	0
I found these shoes to be a great value,construction is good, fit is good, just right for my every day work shoe	1
This is a marvelous spoof book, written in very formal prose, about totally imaginary creatures. (I found a very nice copy at a garage sale selling for a dollar, 50 cents after a bit of bargaining).<br /><br />This was reprinted by The University of Chicago Press with the following legend: &#34;The Snouters was originally published in Germany, under the title Bau und Leben der Rhinogradentia, by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart in 1957. Copyright � 1964 by Gustav Fischer Verlag Stuttgart. Portions of the book appeared in Natural History magazine in April 1967 and is reprinted here with permission. The 15 plates and 12 text figures in this volume were drawn by Gerolf Steiner. The University of Chicago Press, Chicago 60637 The University of Chicago Press, Ltd., London.<br /><br />Maggie Koerth-Baker recently wrote a blog post about the book; the picture she refers to can be found by googling Maggie Koerth-Baker imaginary animals.<br /><br />&#34;In this dusty display box at the University of Maine sits the carefully preserved skeleton of a small, shrew-like rodent which, lacking hind legs, propelled itself along with the help of a long, jointed nose-foot. If that seems a bit too whimsical to be true, well, it is. The creature belongs to the mammalian order Rhinogradentia – an entirely made-up class of animals. Like this specimen, which belongs to UMaine professor Irving Kornfield, the rhinogrades are all rodents and they all have some sort of fantastic nasal appendage ... and, most importantly, none of them actually exist.<br /><br />&#34;Now, there are plenty of imaginary animals in the world and, some of them – like the jackalope, for instance – exist in taxidermy and skeletal form despite not existing as living beings. But most of those are folk-crafts, their origins steeped in tall tales or intentionally profitable efforts to mislead, and their inventors lost to time. Rhinogradentia, on the other hand, is relatively new. It was created in 1961 by a real German zoologist named Gerolf Steiner who wanted to illustrate the way evolution can create diversity in isolated populations. In order to do that, Steiner created a fake German zoologist called Harald Stümpke, a fake island chain called Hy-yi-yi, and a fake order of mammals with funny noses. And then he wrote a book about it.<br /><br />&#34; Published under Stümpke's name, The Snouters: Form and Life of the Rhinogrades, is meant to read like a totally serious zoology handbook of the time period. It's a parody that absolutely refuses to wink at you, and it's become a bit of an in-joke among biologists. This particular specimen was actually built by Kornfield, himself, using real animal bones and illustrations from Stümpke/Steiner's book.&#34;<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book, and enjoyed reading both Maggie Koerth-Baker's description and the marvelous Reviews here on Amazon even more. My only problem is how to dispose of the book, now that I am down sizing my life.<br /><br />Robert C. Ross<br />March 2015	0
I had the original space bags a few years ago (and the product may be better now, I'm not sure) but I didn't feel like they closed properly and they didn't hold tight for more than an hour or so. These are quite a bit better. I like the valve, which was a problem on the &#34;original&#34; because my Dyson wouldn't fit the valve. This valve is clearly made to be compatible with the smaller hose size. I've not seen problems with tearing or found the plastic to be delicate in any way	1
Smaller can be better, especially when you are talking about a device that is intended to be on the compact side of things. This iPad dock is small enough to easily move it about, either in the house or taken in a bag on the road. The included remote control means no more having to stand up to change volume or pause. The dock even has audio outputs so that it can become a part of an audio system while watching movies or video.<br /><br />As a charging port it's factory grade and doesn't overcharge. Use it while charging. The base is stable for being as small as it is. This dock is simply operated and fills my need.	1
It was exactly wat I wanted. It was was way to assemble and apply to the wall, I'm happy with the outcome	1
I have been looking for a cast iron skillet for months, particularly for one with a glass lid. This fits the bill. It is sturdy and easy cleanup. The pre-seasoning that the company did is awesome. I use it all the time. I was so happy with this that I also purchased the 8 inch skillet from Lodge.	0
Great value, and it does what I need it to. Mostly I just wanted some extra storage space, so it's made a nice little shelf over my sink. Serves its purpose.	0
This camera has been really disappointing and totally not worth it. Almost all of the pictures come out distorted as if I had a fishbowl lens on it - really sad to have everyone's face twisted or scenery ruined. It takes way too long (up to ten seconds) to turn on or off once I press the on/off button.	1
The strap arrived very quickly and was easy to attach. Once on the camera it creates a very awkward angle and you must depress the shutter button with your thumb. It places a tremendous amount of strain on your wrist and makes looking through the viewfinder a challenge as well. Back to the neck strap for me - it would have been great if it had worked out as planned.	1
Gorilla glue, the mighty ape! Could be used for something in guerrilla warfare.<br />Gorilla, this is a great alternative to DuPont modeling glue. I be used it to set various stuffs, I didn't want to through away, handles on momento cups, I don't use. But still wanted fixed.<br />Securing magnet to back of a key holder for door key. I just got dentures, BUT WOULD NOT RECOMMEND FOR USE AS A TEMP DENTURE PASTE. Unless to repair broken denture tooth, not fastening to roof of mouth.<br />I've had disastrous attempts to superglue.<br />And doesn't keep well after opening, though does stick to everywhere.<br />Gorilla glue, is easily wiped off with warm cloth, or glued piece filed for cleaner look.<br />When you need it to be tough, but easier to work with.	0
The Man From Cheyenne, 1942 film<br /><br />Cattle graze, men on horses ride up and shoot their pistols to drive them into a cave. "About two hundred." They are placed on trucks and driven away. The "Wyoming Cattlemens Association" hold a meeting on this theft. An alarm sounds outside, there is a robbery. A man shoots at the fleeing automobile. "Nice shooting." The man from the Department of Commerce has a job for him. Roy grew up in that area and would not be suspicious. Cowboys sing as they ride, they meet Roy. Roy meets Judy next. Gabby complains about cattle thefts. There is a meeting of the ranch owners. They want to pool resources and coordinate their activities. One horse threw a shoe. Gabby rides with Roy and Judy.<br /><br />Miriam gives a party on Saturday night. There is music and dancing. [There is comedy.] Then a song. The rustlers struck again! Where did they go? Jim caught one of them, he's one of Miriam's crew. They will take care of Jim and get rid of his horse too. The next morning they notice Jim's absence. When his body is found Roy finds sand in one boot. [Trace evidence.] Roy finds that hidden cave, and Bob finds him. A shot misses them! Roy rides after the shooter and captures him. "He's one of the Hardy men." But Roy is seen near that tunnel! Roy talks to Miriam about the rustlers. He tests her and she fails! The shooting begins, Roy is trapped in the ranch house. Help arrives just in time. Judy and Miriam struggle. Will Roy stay or move on? And so it ends. [No mention of the trials and sentencing.]<br /><br />This is an interesting story about rustling done at one of the cattle ranches. Did this reflect war-time fears about a "fifth column"? My copy had low contrast washed-out video. Some of these movies were cut back to 53 minutes to fit into an hour of TV with advertising.	0
I have very curly hair and like to try new products. I am disappointed in spending over $10 on this and it does nothing.  Possibly the worst thing I have tried so far.  My curls were flat...nada.	0
I use my cell phone to a great extent to watch videos, to chat with friends and internet purposes. It usually gets off within 5 hours if I use it continuously.	1
I did not buy this product because the price is just way too high and it does not make sense to get just a single pad of this notebook. If they're going to charge high anyway, they might as well sell them by the bundle or something.	1
A nice spacious bag that worked perfectly. Holds regular shampoo bottles easily which is what I was looking for and it's a study design.	0
This should be a MUST HAVE resource for all families that are affected by memory disorder in a loved one. I had the privilege of working with both of these gals while I was working in Home Health Care, and they are stars in their field. I would give all of their works a &#34;10&#34; if there were that many stars available.	0
I get this only for me because I can't exactly let my kids have some of this, can I? So now I have my own hidden treat for myself and the kids have their gummy bears and sour patches to keep them entertained.	1
I understand this is a really cheap tent and I wasn't expecting much from it.<br /><br />Through a couple weekends attempts at hiking though it proved very reliable.<br /><br />it's quick and easy for a single person to pop up and break down.<br /><br />It's light to carry too.<br /><br />It kept me dry which is the main thing.<br /><br />And if I were still inclined to go back out there, it would go with me again.<br /><br />But we are not going back out there.	1
I have 3 grandsons who love to put their feet on the backs of the seats. These kick mats protect the backs of the seats very well. They are easily wiped down, and easy to remove to move to another vehicle. I like the protection they provide.	1
Very nice watch to wear anytime, can go for classic and casual wear.<br />Mix of gold and silver let you use it with any matching accessories.	0
These are excellent and very British. They aren't very sweet which I like, they are unique here in the USA as there is not another cookie (biscuit) like these available in the US.  These are way better than the shortbread Duchy biscuits in my opinion.	0
I am very impressed with the quality of this Pastry Scraper and Cutter. It is much heavier than I expected. The handle is very comfortable to hold and makes using it enjoyable	1
This six pocket vertical plant gardener is perfect for my home. Since I live in Brooklyn, New York and it is not very lush with plant life, I fill my home with as many plants as possible. This gardener makes it very simple to have lush plant life growing out of your walls. Below is a picture of the planter that hangs in my room right next to my window, the plants are thriving and I can't wait for them to become big and beautiful!	1
My son really enjoys the lights and music associated with this toy. The light really seem to mesmorize him. We got this as a gift and its great, keeps him occupied and its almost like you can see his brain working as he is lying there. I would recommend this to all parents of little ones.	1
No problems,  It was sent in a soft padded envelope.  Luckly it wasn't bent or damaged. The price was perfect however.	0
Like the product and the extra sheets.  also liked purchases by the case.  Thought there was a coupon but not seeing it currently.	0
I love this small piece, the reason I gave 3-star is the quality of the plug is poor, sometimes it works, sometimes no...Maybe this is exception, I had to return it...	1
Really sweet variant.. Makes the Xbox even that much more fun to play.  The only problem now is who will win the battle of the golden controller. LOL..maybe I'll have to buy two so no blood will be shed.	0
These are just like my apple cables. They feel and looks the same. I haven't encountered and problems with them. I am truly amazed how durable and well built these cables. Worked perfectly fine with my wall and car chargers.	1
These earrings was just lovely, when i received them they was not together, i had to buy super glue to hold them together, but i loved them so kelp them.	1
A great movie and the four actors play so well off of one another, you'd think they knew each other for years.	1
Very Expensive refills.  We purchased the same refill from a local source and these were 1/10 the cost that Amazon refills were priced.  When we ordered the refills, we assumed the product was 100 pages and NOT 100 pictures in the package.  What a rip off.  We saw one review and the lady indicated they were &#34;S-O-O EXPENSIVE&#34; ....boy, she was right.	0
Helped me digest well. Feeling good after taking this supplements. Nicely packaged too! Definitely worth the price ! This pills are easy to swallow too!	1
My husband has very poor eyesight and his glasses can do only so much to correct it, so he uses a magnifying glass regularly for many things.  This little tool has made his life much, much easier when it comes to working on his electronics (he's an electronics hobbyist and does a lot of spot-welding and other things).  At first I was a bit dismayed at how small this is; the magnifying glass is just a bit over 2 inches wide and the base is only about an inch and a half.  However, the Helping Hand seems to be big enough for almost everything my husband has needed, and the adjustable hinges work very smoothly.  So far he's used it for soldering jobs, fixing eyeglass hinges and threading needles (yeah, he sews too!).  I only wish the base had machined holes so that one could anchor the whole tool to a workbench if one wanted, and it wouldn't hurt if the glass was just a bit larger.  With those two modifications, I'd give this a 5-star rating.	0
Excellent to put in between two car seats in my 2014 Honda Odyssey. The kids can put their &#34;stuff&#34; in it without loosing them in between the seats. The cup holders are useless for cups, but come in great for small items.	0
This is a perfect heli of you're going from a co axial and want a 4 channel. The only thing wrong with the packaging is it says it's ready to fly...I would say that's not saying enough. It's not ready, it's wanting to fly! After the batteries were charged I took off straight up into the air and after the gyro settled it just sat there hovering. Killed it from 15 feet up and powered back and it recovered nicely. You can see the gyro doing it's work. 2 speeds is cool. Great little transmitter. Honestly, for the price of this little guy, I haven't flown anything better. Battery could last a little longer but it comes with 2 and the charger charges 2 at once. There are also upgraded batteries and more batteries. Enough ranting....this heli is great!	0
I use it a lot for playing chatting both, it gives excellent service every time, no hassles or flaws.	1
My son never had a diaper rash while using this product.  Tub is not the most sturdy but that is not why I bought this product.	0
Great pillowcases. The color is exactly as it is shown in the photo. Shipped quick and was well packed. Great value for the price. Will highly recommend and buy again soon!	1
I heard too many issues with the knockoff versions of this so I decided to purchase the &#34;official&#34; one. Don't waste money on the &#34;fake&#34; one. Just buy this one.	0
Fun movie so long as not looking for alot of thought.The actors all played their parts well; proof that range is everything for a true actor. They did earn their money 8)	1
I gave this to my sister who just graduated from high school and was going to a state college and she was surprised at some of the information found here.	1
Short Nights of the Shadow Catcher is one of the most interesting books I have read in a long time.  Rarely do you find a biography this well-written. When you finish this book you have to ask yourself: What kind of person works hard to get out of poverty and then becomes so obsessed with a cause that he gives up everything he has worked for, a loving wife and family, a lucrative business, his dignity, and any income at all to follow a cause that he feels only he can accomplish. Author Timothy Egan has given us a great gift in writing this biography.	0
They are quality bungee cords, but I have no idea how long they are going to last in the Florida sun.<br />The nice feature is that they can be shortened very quickly by pushing the bungee cord out of the plastic ball opening and double knotting the end. Pull really hard.......and you're done!	0
I have recently been getting into yoga (or trying desperately!) This little guy is my motivation. I put him on a shelf right by my door to make sure I go to class in the morning. He looks so tranquil. I'm sure he would do fine outside but the colors are so vibrant that I cant even risk him fading. He is just as shiny as he looks like the picture!	1
Regarding the wax itself, it's as good or better than any on the market.  It's not for surface cleaning - find another product for that.  But it does go on and wipe off easily, and lays down a very nice shine.  My gripes on this product are the following:<br />1.  Griots needs to seal the can in a plastic wrap for shipping because the lid falls off and the product spills out.  At $40 a can, I want ALL of the product, not a partial can.  This is the second time this has happened on this product.  I actually quit buying from Griots for over a year because they shipped me a can and during transit part of the product spilled out due to the lid coming off.  When I called their &#34;world famous we want everyone happy&#34; customer service line to request a new can, the dipshot CSR said that they could not replace the product because it wasn't their fault.  He was kind enough to suggest that I scrape up all of the loose wax in the box and microwave it so it would liquefy, then pour it back into the can.  Yeah buddy, why don't you have Richard Griot come over and do that for me.<br />2.  True to their record, no one ships slower than Griots, causing Amazon to miss their committed delivery date.  Amazon needs to threaten them with dropping their products if they don't make the ship date.  The product didn't even get to the shipper for two days.  Unacceptable.  The advantage of buying through Amazon is that you avoid Griot's ridiculous shipping charges.	0
I've only used this twice and I only needed to use it twice. The first time, it worked brilliantly. The second time, wouldn't do anything had all. Only took about a pound of lemons before it quit on me and left me with nothing to work with. Ugh.	1
I purchased three of these aprons to embroider for mother's day. Each held up great to a embroidery machine. After, we used paint to put the kids handprints on the aprons. With both paint and embroidery, I was concerned about washing them for the first time. But they held up great to a front loading washing machine.	1
Bought for my sons party , only worked for a hour ! The steering wheel on/off button stop working and I had to rig it so that it was stay down in the on position , then it completely stop working and blowing bubbles, the wheel still turned but no bubbles came out, I rinsed it with water and let it dry and tried again and it still doesn't work, very sad , this was such a cool toy my son loved it while it worked :/ now it just sits under the sink because it doesn't work	0
These are my favorite chocolate bar by Cadbury.  I received this package and was so pleased with the product.<br />Each bar was fresh and not broken. I am going to order more and more every month!!	1
The design for this is great...the turning mechanism and design worked great, however, the basket center bottom broke away almost immediately and does not balance on the raised spindle, causing the basket to not be balanced and engage with the spin device lid.  Making this a bowl and a top.....no longer a salad spinner.  The basket strainer is made of a very brittle material....	0
This is really the perfect case for the Verizon Galaxy Nexus. Way better than the $20 case Verizon caught me for on day 1. The design on the back is actually bigger than the iPhone, a fact I have pointed out to iPhone fanboys when the start drooling over my larger phone. The cut-out recesses make it very easy to get to the phone's controls. It's easy to grip and the phone actually feels smaller in my hand than with the crumby Verizon case. I especially like the color, and will probably by a complete set of colors to match my shoes and/or my mood.<br /><br />Must remember to buy this stuff here rather than at the Verizon store in the future!	0
I was impress with the beauty of this watch from viewing the web site & returned more than once considering whether or not to purchase. I have disappointed in the past by things that have looked outstanding, but shabby once received.	1
These are a great compliment to my other Zebra accessories for my Jeep. They were just as I expected them to be.	0
As far as tambourines go, this is of a quality that you can't deny. It's pretty great and I love the sound it makes.	1
The watch is good, and half a month to evaluate it.. Function is very full, then call, send and receive text messages, as long as the phone can receive messages including QQ micro channel, etc. can be pushed to the watch, but can not back. Note2, Android 4.3 perfect compatible! Beyond the expected watches and mobile phones can actually connected via the Internet, this just can't pick up the phone can send and receive text messages, push missed calls and all mobile phone to receive the news.	1
I bought this watch because I needed an alarm, and this one works well.  Simple to set (5 or more button presses) and change modes.	0
These are good looking shoes in person.  Unfortunately, they run quite small.  I usually wear a 9 or 9.5, and should have ordered a 10 in this shoe.	0
My daughter loves the watch. It's made well and is exactly what she wanted for her sweet 16. Thank you	0
These shoes fit me perfectly, but I found other ways to wear them too! Their so comfy and the flannel lining keeps my feet nothing but warm in the cold of winter	0
I installed this in an our new home, took less than an hour to setup and install. The siren is very loud. Since purchase, I added smoke alarm and gas leak alarm. I'll be expanding more accessories as needed. My sim card hasn't arrived yet and currently connected to phone line with obihai/google voice.	0
I like this hay... It was fresh.. my rabbit happily had it.<br />I will recommend your products to all of my friends.<br /><br />Thanks for that.	1
These are fine. Needed something for everyday that was basic. A little disappointed with the color. Looks dull. They do bother my ears after a few hours. For the price for such small earrings seems on the cheap side. Service was excellent.	0
I have been looking for some quite time for the right look and great price point for my son's room. This is a well made platform bed frame and has the great tailored look I was looking to achieve. I think it looks good as anything that cost three times as much as this one! Definitely recommend this bed.	1
This case is a dream. Priced right; two positions - one for reading one for typing; looks fabulous; elastic loop for stylus; elastic loop to hold closed; and the part that holds your iPad rotates so you can use it vertically or horizontally. This case looks great and functions well. I give it 5 stars. Highly recommended case for ever.	1
AMAZING.  First: these pants arrived TWO days after I ordered them, FROM INDIA.  The material and designs are beautiful and high quality.  Yes, the pants could be tricky to tie at first -- these are wrap pants, just like wrap skirts.  However, it's not that hard, and if I can figure out an articulate way to explain it,  will update my review.	0
Good product, as described. We have been happy with all of the Boon products that we have tried. We recommend this set.	0
As a mini-bike enthusiast for the past 10 or so years, this is a great mini-bike! I've probably logged about 30 or so hours without having any issues. The bike is super durable and has taken quite a beating on the trails by my house.<br /><br />The bike has a solid 79.5cc ohv engine that can haul and I personally think it looks pretty sweet compared to other minis out there. Shipping was quick, bike came in un-damaged and the assembly was straight-forward. Would (and have) recommend to friends or anyone looking for a very fun ride. Even if you're not an enthusiast, this is a perfect item to just have fun with and is easy to operate. 5/5.	1
My own fault, didn't realize this watch came in two different sizes. I am a big girl & this watch dwarfed my wrist. Can't imagine how it would look on a petite chick. I gave it to my husband. He loves it. Just made it around his wrist. Now I have to decide if I want to go for smaller watch. Love the size of the numbers on the face, also like indiglow feature. Just really huge!	0
This quick release plate was inexpensive but fits and works as well as the original plate. This brand is proving to be reliable.	0
A must have for anyone who needs tools on the go. I off road and this set easily straps to my jeep. Tools are well built and recomend.	1
The biggest problem was, once I received lighting bulb pack, the thing that to remove a single bulb, you must remove all bulbs by resetting the hue bridge to factory default & building the system from the ground up. I had to call a repairman to do this, and when he saw what I bought he laughed at me. He wondered how I got Ethernet cable and in here it said wireless, so I had to put on other wall plug, which was hard, due to &#34;modern&#34; look of my house. Android app is also not helpful, it updates every hour or so and it really ruins the whole process, because I cannot stand by my mobile every time.<br /><br />Nevertheless, my friend who was lightning designer, said that I needed to buy a Phillips 2599 ( http://amzn.to/1wBs8pI ), because its completely wireless and it's easier to install it, he also bought a pack of them, a month ago and said he'll order more because of their quality.	1
Went  from  no weak sketchy signal to one bar of 4G.  I'm pleased  with the result of using 2  boosters.	0
Went into this purchase not expecting much and I was glad to see that it was well worth the bucks. I'm not sure how I made it through living up North all my life never having the luxury of heated seats! This seat cover is a gem and I don't know what I'd do without it now. The elastic strap works well enough for me and it doesn't seem to slide around much so I'm happy. The only thing that I feel I should note is that you DEFINITELY have to unplug the cushion when it's not in use so that you don't run down your battery. Other than that, it's pretty easy to get the hang of and awesome to have every winter!	1
I have been taking this product along with other vitamins and I have noticed some difference in my energy. I have also lost a couple of pounds, but I have begun exercising as well.	1
I Purchased This Product From Another Website & This Very Useful Product For Dog Owners.I Often Travels With My Dog.& It Is Very Helpful for Me.Its Storage Capacity Is Great.& No leakage Problems In It.It Is Very Durable & Easy to Fold.	1
I had a lot of old internal drives that needed to be updated and this was the perfect solution! Thanks!	0
Thank you so much for this pen. It is soft and perfect to each touch. I have tried a couple other stylus before this purchase which resulted as a waste of money. This stylus is worth every penny.<br />I love it<br />Thank you	0
I have no idea what any of the complaints are about(other than those who might have gotten a defective one with the smell issue). There is very little smell and what smell there is, isn't really a bad smell. You can only smell it close to the bed and within hours it was pretty much gone. We got a queen size for the two of us to sleep in and it just poofed up within minutes. It was neat to watch. Within 30 minutes it was already fully expanded. From other reviews, I thought it would take longer. Already did a test run, our sheets fit perfectly on it and it was extremely comfortable. It wasn't too firm or too soft. And it was great for other things too!	0
I have a Char-Broil grill and bought this as a complement for it. It has been a dutiful protector of the grill.<br /><br />It fits well, has a drawstring at the bottom and keep water from the grill well.	0
The iPhone 6 Zentze screen protector comes in great packaging.  It includes the screen and a cloth for cleaning before you place it on you phone. It also is a non slip grip protector screen which is really nice.  Just place it on your phone and your good to go.	0
NOT WORTH IT!!! I took the full bottle but nothing happened. My pain and my headache did not change. I gotta think it's not worth a dime.  This leads me to believe it's a total placebo effect.	1
This piece suited my needs very well without any problems.  There was no change in sound and no difficulty to hook-up.	0
I love the Agadir product line....and use the oil, shampoo and conditioner.  My hair shines and stays perfect for days on end.  Color doesn't fade either even on the golf course!  I highly recommend them!	0
the movie arrived on time. It was a new item. I was not as pleased with the movie as I thought I would be. good one though.	0
I just had our plumber install this in our guest bathroom.  I wanted something high quality that would last for years.  With the exception of the plastic faux metal plate (escutcheon) it's a nice unit.  Here are my pro's and con's:<br /><br />Pro's:<br />1,  Metal knobs move smoothly, feel solid and heavy, feel like quality.<br />2.  I like the control at the top - straight up and down (pictured) is off, turn to left to turn on bath tub, turn to right to turn on water for shower.  Large control at bottom is for temperature and you can leave it set once you find a temperature you like.<br /><br />Con's:<br />1.  The round stainless escutcheon is PLASTIC with a faux chrome plating, like a cheap shower head.  When I tap it vs. my Grohe escutcheon (gosh I hate spelling that word) which is metal, the plastic shower one feels very "cheap" while the one on the tub spout is nice and solid.  I'll report back how it holds up but likely for an infrequently used guest shower it will be fine.<br />2.  No labeling - or graphics - to let users know what the controls do.  I'd like a symbol for shower and a symbol for tub at least on the top lever.<br /><br />Be sure you get the Grohe iBox sold separately  [[ASIN:B002VRJLLO Hansgrohe 01850181 3/4-Inch iBox with Service Stop]] to go with this.<br /><br />I saw the reviews that mentioned it was plastic but went ahead and ordered this unit thinking that it wouldn't make a huge difference.  I guess it does not -- but it feels "cheap" and as you can see from the price above, which doesn't include the ibox, this is NOT a cheap control.  At these prices the escutcheon should be metal.<br /><br />Hope this helps.	0
Great Bag. Looks More Genuine and more professional with great designs. Easy to carry. Space is larger and easily fit things in it. And Price is good really worth it. For an weekend trip this bag is perfect. I also use this bag for travelling around the world.Must buy. recommended.	1
Loved this product. It was easy to apply and looks great on the wall! I would recommend this product to my family and friends.	1
Buttons were hideous so I changed them out immediately.  Color is cute.  Fit is alright.  Still glad I got it.	0
ALEX® Toys - Craft My Embroidery Kit 186T<br />Way too expensive for what I actually got. I'm never paying $12.00 for something this cheap again.	1
A great set a great gift for my dad<br /><br />he loves it!<br /><br />You get what you pay for and Stanley is top quality.<br /><br />I used to use the dollar store brand and they are a waste of money.<br /><br />This is the right one!	1
Works well, although the color seems to be a bit faded...did not have any problems installing. Glad I purchased this!	0
Both my 10yr old and 4yr old loved this game! Gets the kids off the couch and moving and even parents can join in the fun:-)	0
I replaced my living room lamp bulb with this one and wow my whole room is brighter and yet lower wattage then my original bulb so great especially now that summer is gone these gloomy days are not so gloomy with my light. Works fabulous I am definitely getting more for the whole house. 😊👏	1
Extremely simple to install. And very dependable so far.<br />Calls were answered extremely fast and impressed with how fast and courteous the staff was	1
A good buy this was! My wife loves me for buying her this, it gave the results as expected. She applies it about once a day and lasts throughout the day.	1
Assembly was pretty easy, although the provided allen wrench couldn't turn all the way around, making it a bit tedious. The glass is pretty thin, which makes me wonder about it breaking in the future, and would probably look better frosted. Overall, decent value for the money.	1
Perfect fit and holds everything I use for my Phantom, except now I decided to install the blade guards for added safety operating around other people and, of course, it no longer fits in the case.  I still use the case to carry all the support equipment and hand-carry the Phantom separately.  I do recommend the case, and at some point I may decide to remove the blade guards again.	0
The glove was for the wrong hand (My fault). I wear a large hammer glove and this one (marked large) was too small for my hand & I could not put it on.	0
This unit has built-in Wi-Fi and easy to set up and operate. So far I have not yet played other DVD's on it so I cannot tell whether it would play Pal DVD or not. But I guess it will. This blue ray player is the nearest to tv set top box. I do not like squinting to watch videos on smart phone or tablet. But the blue ray player enables to watch videos and even news on regular television. I could dispense with my cable television but for local news and children's programs such as cartoon network and Nick. the player gives me access to both free programs and paid services such as Netflix, Hulu and Amazon.	0
I am using this keyboard for just few hours and it is great! Very comfortable and stylish. I have used logitech for most of the time, so just thought try something new.	0
This cabinet has just the right look and room to hold the items I wanted to put in it. I say almost perfect because I didn't feel that the back panel of the unit looked strong enough to support a full cabinet, because it seems to be made of untempered masonite. So I reinforced the interior top of the cabinet with a piece of wood to drive screws through and distribute the weight better. It was not a big deal to do and it's a nice cabinet for the money.	0
This is a small, brite, and lite flashlite. It is real light and I like the fact that its really brite and ergonomic. Fits in the hand good and saves on batteries.	1
Good sizing for a 6'5&#34; 200lb+ man...comfortable but still noisy when moving around (typical for most camping mattresses though).	0
The EAS AdvantEDGE is a low carb sport drink.  I prefer the strawberry flavor over all of the others (although the vanilla and chocolate ones are good, also).  This packs in vitamins and nutrients and works well for low carb diets or if you're training.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that you'll need to brush your teeth or have some gum handy after you drink it - sometimes it gives me halitosis.  Not so bad that I would stop buying it, though. I've been using this product for 3+ years and keep going back to it over Muscle Milk (horrible aftertaste) and other generic options.	0
I wasn't really watching about vampires and all. But this one got me. I just watched this first season and I am planning to watch the next season. I guess I am becoming addicted to it. It was really thrilling and not full of drama that's why I like it. Soon to watch the next one!	1
I have this product, will give this a 3 star rating, nice keyboard and has a soft touch. Weight is match the product description. So far so good, lenovo still the best brand.	1
This review is for the peeler with the Y shaped blade.  Lightweight and peels potatoes and cucumbers very smoothly (the two items i tired peeling with it.)  Not a lot of peelers cut smoothy due to distance and angle between blades.  These guys actuality got that right!	0
This would be the perfect small gift for the musician in your life. They will thank you long time for the thought. It's one size fits all design will work on any model, each and every time.	1
This item was tested with two different babies whose eyes could focus well enough to see projecting images, one of the cutting edge features of this swing. We also tested an older, bare bones wind- up swing for comparison. The wind- up swing has no bells and whistles.<br /><br />No question about it. The Fisher Price Swing performed better and entertained the babies longer and even gave relief to a colicky baby.<br /><br />Other benefits and features:<br /><br />1.We found it very easy to put together, perhaps 25 minutes.<br /><br />2. Easy to fold and store. I know some find it takes up too much space but we have a designated closet for a grandchild, a mini walk- in closet and it easily holds the swing, a portable crib, and baby monitor.<br /><br />3. Definitely held the babies' attention. Calmed a colicky baby, as noted above.<br /><br />4. I had not been totally pleased with the wind-up swing because it always put our son to sleep, giving me temporary peace but disrupting his nap schedule. The Fisher Price swing didn't bore babies to sleep but held their attention. Sometimes they fell asleep but no more often than their usual sleep pattern.<br /><br />5.We could use the projector even when the swing was motionless.<br /><br />6. Very easy to clean<br /><br />7. Although we got ours free to test, I find the price very reasonable for all the features. A friend, impressed,  is ordering one.<br /><br />If you want to use this right out of the box, be sure to purchase 4 D batteries first. Highly recommended!	0
This thread is great for sewing books together.  I have looked locally for some thread, but can't find it anywhere.  The quality is great.	0
I have been using Chris's Tai Chi for awhile and love it, so also started using this video.<br /><br />Like the Tai Chi, he again is a great instructor with tips and clear guidance.  These are a series of 8 different exercises with variations that are really good to focus on issues (He explains what each exercise does if you select to watch the introduction.  I suggest doing so at least the first time you try an exercise.  After that you can just go to the exercise if you like.)<br /><br />The bonus routines are also really good.	1
definitely is perfect just in 5 minutes can program it is very easy no more molestis or disadvantages when enjoying a movie, the video tutorial shows step by step how to set it from 0, now I can enjoy my favorite channels, sports movies , documentaries and fought most and best of all is the lifetime warranty offered gbox SUPER Q Key. certainly recommend	1
Don't waste your time looking any further.  Buy this.  Best on the market and gives off more heat than all the other look a likes.	0
[[VIDEOID:8717f46501007f1576b66bb4a3919049]]Just like my simple rubber sink plug - sometimes simple is simply the best. And this all purpose press follows suite with quality that will last a long time.    The one particular aspect I never experienced before... the olive pitter! That right there makes me very, very happy. :)    And I was wondering what the notches were for farther back on the handle.. a fish scaler! Though in truth, I'd probably use my own scaling knife, but that is a neat touch to have on hand in case one can't find the more specialized tool (which happens all to often to me).    -- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.	0
I had previously written a bad review for this radio, citing weak antenna performance. My bad. I took the radio out walking with me and it works fine, and it picks up a lot of AM and FM stations. I guess the reception inside my house is bad for some reason, but out in the open this radio performs very well. Sound is a bit tinny, but that's to be expected for such a small radio and at such a low price. I'm glad I bought it. It does what I wanted it to do: allow me to pick up NPR and the local classical music station when I'm doing my daily walk.  As a bonus, I can also pick up the CBS AM station (740, KCBS) in San Francisco, which is a great source of Bay Area traffic and weather information, updated every 10 minutes.	0
Stunning stunning and stunning. That's all I can think of when I go to describe this watch. My husband bought this for me for a just because gift here recently and I couldn't be happier with it.	1
This really is heat resistant. I took my time to test this baby out to see if it would really protect my hands or not. Results were great. I touched a super hot oven and I didn't even feel a thing. Affordable !	1
The delivery came on the estimated arrival day.<br />It arrived in more pieces than it should have, meaning broken.	1
these are so adorable, not too big and not too small and the jeweled middle is just too cute!! Love me some baby bling!	0
This has been a great lamp! I like all of its different lighting functions - there's a setting for every situation. It folds up so discretely, and even has a USB charging port in the side. I have used this lamp as a universal resource, because there's so much you will find out that you will use it for. For any college student - this is a &#34;must have!&#34;	1
These Almonds is a healthy snack and a very reasonably priced. Just adequate amount of salt. Super happy with the purchase and will order more.	1
Besides including detailed information on the structure of the test (even if you think you know the structure, you'll probably learn something), it gives helpful and easy-to-remember strategies. Furthermore, the book includes concise yet helpful review	1
Terrific product I have used these for years on daily drivers and race cars as well.<br />Get one for all your vehicles!!!	0
Great,i bought panasonic home theater and it is amazing,the package was in good condition and it took me few minutes to go through the manual and here to install was as easy and fast.	1
Excellent tool kit delivered promptly by amazon as always. One small disappointment is that package seal is broken. Don't know why. Apart from that all is good.	1
This is to be a mans necklace, as i bought it for my boyfriend, but the chain is not manly at all. I didnt like the quality of necklace either.	1
I really like these push up bars. They are well made and allow me to get a much better range of motion and get a better chest workout.  I use them in conjunction with sit-ups, chin-ups, and running in order to lose weight and get in shape.  I found a  fat burning combo supplement that I found on Amazon and it has really kick started my weight loss! It is a daytime and nighttime fat burner that allows you to burn fat around the clock. The daytime fat burner is called PhenRx [[ASIN:B00F5FNCVY PhenRx - Diet pills for weight loss and appetite suppression. 100% money back guarantee!]] and the nighttime fat burner is called PhenRx PM [[ASIN:B00GR6ED04 PhenRx PM - Stimulant free night-time diet pills for weight loss, appetite suppression, enhanced sleep, and decreased cortisol levels. 100% money back guarantee!]].  Combine the workouts on this bike along with these fat burners and watch the pounds melt away!	1
Pendrive is very good, It is compatible with all Android OS. Read and write speed is also remarkable.<br />But one problem with this pendrive is , it is heated up very much withing first usage means upto 7-8 days. but after, its all ok..	1
I wear this product everyday man its some thing I like to wear and its beautiful, I'm always getting questioned about where did i find this product oh I need one. It's a nice piece of jewelery	0
I bought one for myself. It is surely made in a high quality material but there's a little problem with stone. anyway, it's absolutely good for the price.	1
I got this for my son for him to begin his little adventures. Yes I know the picture quality isn't all that but the price is good and my little tyke is happy!	1
I am very happy with this pad. It saves my hardwoods and I believe the cushioning makes the very quiet machine even quieter. Would recommend getting this with any exercise equipment on wood floors.	1
This Made by Johnny-Long Slv Handkerchief Hem Tunic makes me look slimmer!!!<br />It's comfortable to wear and it goes well with my legging and jeans...<br />My friends wanted it too, so I got extra for my friends as well.	1
We purchased two for these for our trip to Italy. We wanted something that would carry a good amount of clothes and that we could carry on our backs. The bags carried fit a good amount of items and were a comfortable fit when carrying. We checked our bags so I cannot speak to how easy it fit in the overhead. We look forward to using these going forward.	0
Fresh'n Clean shampoo is quite good aside from its price it works better than other expensive brands sold in vet clinic. I love the smell and it makes the coat super soft and shiny.	1
Cheap solution to stacks of magazines laying around. They are not going to last forever as the plastic is a little flimsy but it does the job.	1
Sleek, cool and functional. when you have a small place even the smallest additions start to make things look cluttered. I dont even need a desktop anymore with this keyboard and my ipads. Apple is an amazing company and Im glad other companies create accessories to compliment all the functionality.	1
It appears I'm in the minority when I say that I like this movie.  I thought it was a good blend of humor, action, and fun.  Not a five star movie, but easily a solid four star movie	1
probably one of the best things i have ever seen until now, the appgun is more like an extension to a game that the iPhone already has, it doesn't change the game and nothing like that, it just makes it easier for you to play it and the way of playing it.<br /><br />mostly a lot of the accessories about an iPhone might be really expensive and well this is not the problem with this one, a really good advantage about it is that you find an a lot better way of finding the game fun. the gun is not even heavy for no one, is like a little toy a little kid would have,both of your hands can perfectly fit on the trigger and is perfect toy for any kid.<br /><br />i highly recommend it !	1
tiny and cute stool, my two years old son love it.it is just 7.6&#34;*6.5&#34;, but that is enough for him to sit	1
I brought this ring as an everyday wedding ring. I bought another style as a wedding band, and with my job I can't wear a ring with too much bling, so I needed a back up. This ring hit it out of the park!!! I've gotten a lot of complements already. Sizing was exact.	1
I got this for $4.99 and for that price it's well worth it. I live in NYC and we have had 2 snow/ice storms since I got it so I've been able to try it out twice. I really like the squeegee side, which I used both to push heavy snow off the car and to clear snow from my windows. The brush is pretty good too, makes it easier to break apart the snow stuck to the car. The scraper is EXCELLENT. Probably the best scraper I have used. It easily scraped the ice of my windshield and windows with ease.<br /><br />I took off one star because I did have some issues with this snow broom. First, I wish the brush head was wider. At only a little over 7&#34; wide, you have to make several passes get the snow off sections of your car. Second, the brush head and the scraper are not level on mine, which gets annoying when I have to rotate it when I flip it over to use the other side. It doesn't lay flat because if the brush is flat on the ground the scraper is turned about 45 degrees, so it balances on it's edge. Also, the soft cushion grip slides, especially when the metal handle is really cold.<br /><br />For the $5 price it is excellent. I wouldn't pay more than that for it. My 10&#34; snow broom was only $10, and that clears the car much quicker, but doesn't have a squeegee and the scraper is not as good. Between my two snow brooms I am prepared for whatever mother nature throws my way!	0
I love the fact that my wife got these for me, as we're a big cook out family. These make shredding my famous pulled pork even easier now! no more burning my fingers, or getting meat everywhere. Easy to use and easy to clean.	1
This rug is exactly what I ordered. The colors are true and the pattern is very nice. It is under the dining room table and makes the rook look complete. I was trying to match the Pottery Barn wall color rain and it really looks great. Very happy.	1
Great for my amp and all the other racks I have.  Construction seems a little weak though compared to other rack units.	0
The best tasting gummi of all brands, but just be sure to brush afterwards.  you can hear the lil bears eating away at your enamel the moment you bite down on them.  Also remember it has RED 40 listed in the ingredients, which is very controversial in the health world.	0
These pedals attach very easily and stay attached. I like them a lot. They're great even though they're a little pricey. Recommended to anyone who may need occasional platforms on a bike equipped with clipless pedals.	1
Do not get this one, it has very little detail for a master grade, needs alot of panel line work, the red face plate is actually clear in the box and most of the model is made up of a purple-gray plastic that does not look like the color in the picture	0
Took care of all my ants.  Just put it beside their trail as close as you can with out crossing it and in a few days they are all gone.	0
Easy set-up.  Excellent customer service from US, English Speaking Representatives.  So far no problems. Great picture, easy connectivity to WiFI, with a multitude of apps.	0
Very good product. I already started dropping weight, and gaining more strenght. These capsules aren't hurting my body totally, if I'm not drinking too much capsules. Thanks for creators for amazing product	1
Bought it on sale for my wives enclosed tree stand. Works very good and my wife says I'm spoiling her with a comfortable hunting place.	0
Bought this to use with my circular saw to cut pavers for a flower bed. My first time even using a saw and this blade was perfect. I'm sure I wore it out, but for the price it did the job!	0
This chair is awesome. It looks like a real Stickley, but for a fraction of the price. I am extremely happy with it. I got it as a gift for my daughter who is expecting a baby. It seems to be made extremely well too.	1
Great scrubbers, they get the job done!<br />The bristles are very firm, and will hold up and last for a long time.<br />The rubber handles allow a good grip, and the angled heads make it easier to reach where you want it to.	0
As soon as I received the product I tried it (had to give it to my cousin because I didn't realize it wasn't the right one for my home theater) it worked perfectly.	0
I'm a Pilates instructor so I figured this might be a good video to get so that I may tell some of my baby boomer clients to buy it.  It is very suitable for the boomer population that need basic exercises.  The pictures and descriptions of the muscles being worked was kind of neat.  I would not purchase this DVD if you are already super in shape and can do reformer Pilates.  Otherwise it's worth the $12.99.	1
My cat is an adult size cat who is, per the vets opinion, not over weight and is healthy. I had to shove the poor thing in there. And though he is sweet, my cat doesn't like to be held or cuddled so a smaller crate was definitely a bad idea- he became so distraught he used the bathroom twice in it.	1
Don't waste your $$$. The slots for the rings tear and can't hold even the smallest rings. I'm in the process of returning.	0
Very easy to install. Water taste good. Price is reasonable. I highly recommend to buy this one with Insinkerator dispenser.	0
Bought for my daughter and she loved it! She says it makes her feel more hip than just Mommy. Reasonable room but not for over night gigs need another bag!	0
Fits as advertised but the pen holder is useless. Leather is very thin and pliable. I was actually looking for a more sturdy leather.	0
Profoundly written and very useful for teachers whether in public or secular schools, higher education - colleges,	0
Bought this rug for our outdoor deep seating sectional.  What a great online purchase. The colors are dark brown, blue and green.  Gorgeous pattern and very comfortable to walk on.  It's much better than several hundreds dollars indoor rug I bought in the past.  I consider buying another one for our dining table indoor. Highly recommended!!!	0
This is a pretty pendant. But the cloth part of the shade is an unpleasant yellowed ivory, and the diffuser is bright white; they clash. It's not subtle, either. If the pendant looked like the misleading photo shown here.	1
What can be said about a memory card.It works great.Got this to put music on the PSP for my son. It worked with no problems at all.	0
I was looking to buy some mic headphones for my 360 when i stumbled upon this product. It looks and feels a bit weak so you have to be careful with it but aside from that the sound is crystal clear and it is really comfortable. If your looking for a nice cheap pair of these then these are good, but if you can, try to get some higher end ones because these are a bit weak.	1
It came complete but quickly started falling apart afterwards. It's not as easy to play as it seems to be portrayed as well.	1
I am a neophyte with telescopes and decided that for what I want to do, this would be a good entry model for me.  I was mostly interested in looking at and photographing the moon, maybe some planets, and possible use it for other celestial background photo work.  It was also a shot at getting my feet wet before I plopped down thousands of dollars to find out I got the wrong stuff.  Turns out this is a good choice to cut my teeth and learn lessons.  The unit is fairly rugged, self-contained, and more or less sealed so you can't accidentally mess something up.  It is heavy...too heavy for even the best camera tri-pod.  Combine that with the Earth's habit of rotating objects out of your field of view fairly quickly, you need a specifically designed tri-pod to handle it.  I got the one from Celestron with the azimuth controls so once I get the moon in the telescopes sights, I can rotate some knobs and keep it in view.  That works well without having to invest in a &#34;clock&#34; type mount.  Photography can be done a couple of ways without investing in those purpose built units which are big on price tags and low in resolution.  The first way is to use an adapter to mount a digital SLR body to the unit. The second is what I did, which is another adapter from Celestron that allows you to mount a point-and-shoot type digital camera behind the eyepiece.  I used an Olympus TG-2 which worked really well, once you got everything aligned.  In some ways, using the rear display of the camera is easier to find and keep your subject in frame.  As for the actual quality of the image, I am not an expert.  It seems very crisp to me and I don't seem to see any color issues.  What is important is setting the unit up correctly.  You need to use some local object to &#34;sight in&#34; the cross-hairs in the spotter scope to match what you see in the telescope.  Once that is done, it is far easier to find your astronomical targets.  It is still weird getting used to the idea of getting my eyes aligned directly behind the eyepiece and about an inch away from it.  I also like that the image is &#34;right side up&#34; like a binocular view rather than the flipped over version most telescopes have.  This will allow me to use it for nature viewing as well.  This unit will get me through my learning phase until I know better what I want and how much money I am willing to spend.  I have attached two photos.  One is of the telescope on the tripod with the digital camera adapter.  The other is the first photo of the moon I took with it.	0
I love this as a water glass.  I work in a spa so using this with my glass straw looks like a beaker and is stylish in my treatment room.  It holds the water temp and keeps the flavor.  I can not fit it safely into the dishwasher however so cleaning is kind of a pain.	0
What to say. The labels work as they should. They are sticky. They work great with my Dymo Turbo Labelwriter. 5*****	1
''We moved to a new house with a longer driveway and the view of the street is barely visible through all the trees and shrubs. Not to mention, we live on a dirt road, so every time someone drove by it almost sounded as if they were pulling in the driveway.<br /><br />After reading reviews on multiple products I decided to go with this long range Skylink kit. It was here in a matter of days and I had it setup within minutes. I screwed the sensor to the base of a tree 10' from the street and have the alarm in the kitchen. Probably 200' apart.<br /><br />It works like it should and lets me know when someones here. ''	1
This is a really good case and I feel like my Vita would be adequately protected if I were to drop this case (not that I'd TRY, mind you, but I feel secure with it in this case).<br /><br />That said,  I have a couple of wishes:<br /><br />1.  The case can hold 3 game cartridges and 1 memory card.  I WISH that it could hold 6 and no memory card.  I have a 32 GB card and I don't intend on switching these out.<br />2.  I wish it had a detachable strap...even a hand strap would be great.  The case is fairly large and carrying it for extended periods means you need to have a secure grip on it.<br /><br />Other than that, top marks - great case!	0
This product is very difficult to use. When using the player you are unable to determine if the device is on or off because the indicator light is on top of the device, totally out of sight. It is hard to determine how to get most of the features to work after it set up as well.	1
It's always been my companion at work. I love this 3 in one Kopiko because I can make instant coffee while at work, even if i'm really busy. The taste is strong but sweet and I really like it.. the smell and all.. it's perfect..	1
This has worked great for my husband.  In the reviews, one said to order the longer one whether you need it or not but I wished I had ordered the shorter one.  Other than that, it is great!	0
My grandson received one before his birth. He is now four.  It is still his favorite bedtime &#34;friend&#34;. This is a third one as the previous ones have worn out. Oh, they wash beautifully.	0
Yes I like it for its reasonable price and steady stand. But I cannot give it 5 stars because the sharp/hard plastic edge will definitely cut your fist bloody if you accidently hit the ball a little bit lower... No more typing, I have to wrap my hand...	0
A nice little folder for papers you do not want to misplace.  However, if you are loooking for a portfoilio to hold more than 20 sheets, this is not for you.  Keeps my bills organized.	0
It's amazing how difficult it can be to find a baby-friendly wipe out there that doesn't smell or have harsh chemicals. These are very nice, and I like that baking soda is used as the cleaning agent. The wipes aren't super-moist like most others, so sometimes I add a little bit of water to make it go further.	0
i was looking for a comfortable boot which i could use for my adventure job and here i got them.these boots are very comfortable and easy to walk with even in a rocky area.	1
Been on the phone for days now and i must say that it does everything that is stated in the description. Like the anti finger print aspect the most because i am always texting, like a lot! And i have to constantly wipe my prints away but not with illumishield	1
I'll never buy this model seeing as my local roaster is my favorite. I use the reusable cups exclusively. Guess it's back to a french press.	0
A bit disappointed with this one, my previous refill lasted for years, this one is nearly dry after 3 weeks. Maybe coming from an old stock? Maybe a default on the one I have received?	0
I've been wearing Boots all my life..I was a Truck Driver I drove a 75ft. 13 Car Automobile Transport & I wore the Best Boots like Red Wing,& Browning Boots & all were Waterproff & Insulated.. All the Boots had tie up Laces .. I injured my Achilles Tendon & everytime I tied my Boots up I was putting Pressure on that injury.. so I thought let me try a slip on Boot.. while looking on Amazon's site I saw the Kamik Men's Dawson Waterproff Winter Boot..  I looked at the boot and I liked it.. when I got it  I thought I had my Bedroom Slippers on  it was Comfortable ok now But I have not worn them in the rain or Snow yet  & the price was rite too.	1
Great way to organize baby's stuff in the car. We keep a second stash of diapers, burp cloths, sanitizer and other goodies for when we travel. No clutter in the back of the car thanks to this handy thing!	1
Easy to read and use. Love the soft silicon cover that it came with it. Great to keep track of my pulse rate when am working out or running.	1
This sofa table arrived in perfect shape, and was easy to put together. The finish is a painted aluminum and is slightly distressed, but it has nice detailing with the flared foot leg, and looks much more expensive than it is. I was going to buy a much more expensive one at and then saw this.	1
Delicious...  Warning:  Be prepared to run a few laps after eating....  Hard to stop eating them.......	0
So where's the sound? This is definitely long and the first time I used it the sound was actually top notch but now there's nothing! What the heck?	1
These tasted stale and outdated before the expiration date even comes close.  we were doing a taste test to know what we had before needed what we had stored.  These were years before the expiration dates were due.	0
I absolutely love. It makes wonderful sound and I would definitely recommend it to anyone that wants play beautiful music.	0
I had to do some figuring out while assembling this item. The small instructions paper was hard to read and did not give many details. It took me over fifteen minutes to figure out the first step and I noticed a dent on the lower end of the tube probably made by someone who lost patience and tried to force it with pliers. That was also an indication that I did not receive a brand new item. The whole assembly process was mostly intuitive. Then I was surprised by the goose neck which I did not notice by the Amazon images, my fault. It's straight from the 1950s the whole makeup. Plus that goose neck is quite stiff and not so flexible as one might think from the images. The electric cord was also surprise, I had assumed the LED lamp worked with batteries. Also, the cord is designed to be plugged to a USB wall socket adapter which could be an ingenious way to do away with the AC/DC converter.	0
I just bought this as a replacement and went for an RFID because I just got my new credit cards and this come with a chip. This really meat my expectations, and here are a couple of observations after a couple of weeks of using this. The RFID blocking works well; the wallet completely blocked the card reader I tried at a fast food restaurant, when paying for a meal no matter which way I turned the wallet the scanner did not read my cards. It appears to be a good quality leather, and it's well made. I like that it has enough pockets for all my credit cards, and really like the ID flip out and the currency divider.<br /><br />Overall Good quality for the price. Seems as good as, if not better than, some of the wallets that are 2x the cost	1
I have been wearing CASIO G-SHOCK Watches since high school and this is the best looking one I have seen yet. Durable and well priced, you can't ask for much more then that.	1
Applied to Galaxy tablet with ease and you can't even tell it's there. After first applying, surface was not immediately smooth as I hoped. Wiped the screen off with a damp rag, it's now as smooth as the screen glass itself. Awesome product with a great price.	1
It's a solid product, which I've used for two years.  Plays AVIs from usb drive and dvd media without a hitch.  Only thing lacking is HDMI port.	0
Save time inflating the balloons with this.  I bought this because it is so much cheaper buying it all together in a kit like this.  Separately this pump is $8  and a bag of balloons is $ 9 add in the price of a book (most are $ 10 or more) and it's a good bargain.  I have been comparing instruction videos on youtube and nothing I have found online for free comes even close to the quality of the videos that are included here.  I hope they release more soon, I would subscribe!	1
I purchased the DVD based off of all the instagram photos and celebrity transformations I have saw. Overall I like the DVD. The workouts are simple enough to do. You will sweat. A tip I recommend is to always put more into each set that you do for better/quicker results. I love how the mother engages you by being active through EVERY single workout. She pushes you to finish.<br /><br />As far as the daughter's workouts, very &#34;squaty.&#34; That's pretty much all she does, besides give instructions on what you should be doing instead of demonstrating. I love all the leg workouts she does in her segment, and I really love all the Ab workouts. I really don't watch her anymore, but I use the other lady in the back, Christy. She does everything. As she pushes, I push.<br /><br />Complaints: The low audio quality. The sound is drowned out by the background and my the music. You have to turn up the DVD to a higher than normal level to hear what is being said. Also there is some issue with the transitions into forms with Lana's portion.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, you DO NOT have to follow the meal plan associated with the DVD. I used my own regular foods, at a lower rate than I would normally do. I just eat smaller portions, and eat more (wise food choices) frequently. I can tell a huge difference in just one week of working out. You have to have SOME sort of diet or discipline. Just because you workout, does not mean you will lose weight, you must also watch you intake.<br /><br />Good luck ladies. You can follow me on IG if you like @XIjaneiX	1
The worst. Does not grip onto small or medium cans. Had an automatic before that worked well but this one sucks. Going back to my manual one until someone makes a can opener that works	1
Turmeric is a great anti-inflammatory and this one is terrific, the response has been good, I've got much less aching since adding it to my diet!	1
Works great watching full movies before needing a recharge. The longest so far has been Schindler's List at just over 3 hours long and it didn't have much but there was still some battery life left. Haven't tried all the functions yet but hey. They make good products.	1
I was taking another brand of this same supplement and had run out. I hadn't noticed any benefits with the other brand so I decided to read reviews of other products and see if there was a better one out there. After reading all the reviews of this one I decided my mother brand lacked many key elements and wanted to give it a try.  Glad I did. Make sure you read your ingredients and reviews people not all products are med equally. I am very happy with this product and will continue to order this one from now on.	0
Mortal Kombat X - Xbox One From a gameplay perspective, Mortal Kombat X easily eclipses everything that's come before it. NetherRealm has taken all that they learned in the making of 2011's Mortal Kombat and Injustice: Gods Among Us to create an MK experience to appeal to both casual and hardcore fans.  The &#34;Kollector's&#34; Edition gets good marks too and in addition to the game you also get a Scorpion Figurine by Coarse, Certificate of Authenticity, Gold Scorpion Skin and Kombat Pack Downloadable Content. It might be worth checking out here:  http://fave.co/1c3tmZ7  Mortal Kombat X does play well. Moving back to 2D combat was the best move for Mortal Kombat after some clunky efforts at 3D play from a couple of generations ago, as it has allowed the team to focus on linear combos and giving the attacks a brutal characterisation behind them.  Balancing is good, though it won't take long for each player to find their favorites. I personally became accustomed to Cassie quickly. Partly because I didn't want to be on the receiving end of the ball busting move, but also because she's quick and her attacks have good flow to them. I found the bigger, heavier characters to be almost unmanageable in how clunky their attacks flowed together, but of course the first time I jumped online I ran into someone who showed me what those characters were capable of (and left me with a shredded Cassie to show for the lesson).  It remains a very accessible fighting game, with relatively small move lists for each character, though at the start of each battle it's possible to select from three different "stances”, which effectively means that each character is three different play styles in one.  The complete list of characters in the game, some of which are classics include: Baraka, Bo' Rai Cho, Cassie Cage, D'Vorah, Daegon, Ermac, Erron Black, Ferra & Torr, Fox, Frost, Fujin, Goro, Jackson Briggs, Jacqui Briggs, Jason Voorhees, Johnny Cage, Kabal, Kano, Kenshi, Kitana, Kotal K'etz, Kotal Kahn, Kuai Liang, Kung Jin, Kung Lao, Li Mei, Liu Kang, Mileena, Nightwolf, Predator, Quan Chi, Raiden, Rain, Reptile, Sareena, Scorpion, Shang Tsung, Shinnok, Shujinko, Sindel, Smoke, Sonya Blade, Kurtis Stryker, Suchin, Takeda Takahashi, Tanya, Taven, Tremor  In short I'd recommend picking yourself up a copy of:  http://fave.co/1c3tyHJ	1
Initial Impression:<br /><br />So far so good.  It took me about 5 minutes to unbox, make it through the instructions and get the cycle started.  The first 10 or 15 minutes it just aimlessly moved around without doing much cleaning (as its supposed to) and when I came back out not more than 15 minutes later I could see a noticeable difference where the cleaner had gone.  Its about 1.5 hours into its first cycle and I'm very happy with the results so far.<br /><br />Build quality looks good.  I opened it up to check out the filters etc, and everything seemed to be well made.<br /><br />I have a beach entry pool, and it figured it out pretty quickly and stops when it gets to approximately 2&#34; of water and turns around and heads back into the pool.  I was impressed at how it navigates the walls and steps.  Several times I thought it was going to tip upside down and it righted itself before it did.<br /><br />I'll update the review after a few weeks/months, but at this point I'm ecstatic about the purchase.  I'm in Florida and don't have a screen enclosure for my pool so as you can imagine I spent ridiculous amounts of time brushing and skimming leaves off of the floor.<br /><br />If it cut my time in half I would be happy with the purchase, but based off of what I see so far - I would be surprised if it doesn't almost eliminate the need for me to do it manually.	0
I love Keds! They are one of the most long-lasting shoes I've ever had. I use my old Keds for 2 years already but they are still perfect. Although my feet got bigger but I gave it to my sister which loves Keds too. I recommend this to those girls who wants sneakers that would last a lifetime.	1
I have been looking for this table for almost a YEAR now and could not find it anywhere because it was never available or sold out. I happened to see it here again on Amazon and I am elated! I had to get it because it is the ultimate statement piece for my dining room and I really love the modern look of it. The expresso is true to it's color and it is very shiny and gorgeous, constantly looks like I just shinned the thing! An awesome piece that I get compliments on a daily basis, also the perfect height -highly recommended!	1
I had this bottle for a week and loved it, excecpt that it leaked and when you tightened down the lid enough so that it did not leak the lid cracked and broke. For the price I expected better.	0
i purchased this as a gift for my eighteen years old daughter and she really liked it,its color is awesome since it goes with any outfit.	1
Great fit, great look. Would definitely recommend. Will show some discoloration over time. But for the price you can treat yourself to a new one every few months.	1
So like everyone else, I was very skeptical of ordering a bed online without testing it out first. I was definitely NOT disappointed. This is such a comfortable bed, I am IN LOVE!!	1
I bought this unit to play non blue ray discs but wanted the upvert ability. I did not want to use the wifi. The first two months the player was fine. After that there would be hesitations in the play of movies.	1
This was a truly excellent game that showcases how far gaming has evolved. It's like a playable movie, but it's not boring or repetitive.	1
My wife's favorite grinder and It does an excellent job but it doesn't last.  We have gone through three of them and have moved on.	0
My son lost his violin bridge and we bought 3 of the 1/2 size. I received the package in two days. My son took the bridge to school and had his techer install it for him. The teacher said it was a nice bridge and wanted to know where I bought it. I was very happy with the teachers review since i have no idea how this things work. Anyway, I've told friend and family about your store. Thank you.	1
My dog is afraid of this thing.  It's very noisy if used on a hard floor and pretty difficult for the dog to get food out of it.  Maybe my dog is not a genius yet.  But there is only the one hole on the side, so the dog has to tip it just the right direction, and completely horizontal for any food to be ejected.  I'd return it if I had saved the packaging.	0
great war movie and a classic one, a friend told me he purchased this movie here and I was really happy to receive it, because it was this movie that made me a collector of war movies, I do like the drama and the thrill  and watching this with popcorn and friends is just great...	1
For the price I feel that we got a good deal. The duffle bag did get a little hole in it but I think that was my own fault. I am pleased with the price and usage of the luggage.	1
I luv taking selfie, and it was difficult doing so since my phone came without a self timer, so when I saw this LEDago selfie stick on Amazon website, I just had to have it .It can stretch up to 40 inches and allows you to set your phone at a 180 degree angle it is also comparable with most android, I know cause all my friends wants to use it :-) the rubber pad that comes along with it also helps your phone to fit firmly too. It's a great gift idea and so easy to use .	1
Softer jerkies tend to have a lot of water which requires the preservatives. Jerky is supposed to be tough to a degree- especially if you are only using muscle meat and not anything else The guy who says it's like a "teriyaki flavored shoe" is over exaggerating.<br />I don't think Field Trip sacrificed anything in terms of quality to achieve an all natural healthy option to all the other jerkies out there.	1
Very cheesy, not a good product for adult entertainment--maybe for a child's party.  It broke the same day!  I was very disappointed.  I bought it for a party that I had my the basement.  It doesn't reflect in an open floor space.  This is more-so for a kids party in a room not a big basement. It was a total waste of money!	0
The SDDG is a refreshing look at the challenges of working in ministry while balancing spiritual and family vitality. Greer shares honestly about his experiences, joys and struggles while leading a scaling Christ-centered development organization. His honesty and candor in addressing the potential pitfalls and tensions of leadership is refreshing. Insightful, humorous and encouraging, SDDG is highly recommended reading.	1
I can't believe a toaster could be this bad! It burns all of the edges but leaves the middle hardly browned!	1
I will give them 5 but the dome led  was to big probably they have to reworked the shape od the led led dome light in a corolla 2011 has a litlle pointed edges that will fit in the socket and there where not edges and around .050  bigger  too bad I had to order a different set for another company beside that the rest of led fit ok	0
I am very familiar with this seat as I babysit my nephew daily and he has this exact model.  I only have a couple complaints about the seat and they're not major issues.  Now that I am pregnant, I will likely buy the same seat for my own child.  P.S. my nephew is now in the chicco next fit and I absolutely love it!<br /><br />Pros-<br />Operation..all around.  The way it latches and unlatches from the base is easy.  The way the belts tighten and loosen to fit baby is great.  The operation of the handle is also much easier to fold back than some I have seen.<br /><br />Installation was so easy.<br /><br />The material feels durable without being stiff.<br /><br />Cons-<br />The canopy doesn't cover much at all.<br />The seat is quite heavy, but most are heavier than they should be in my opinion.<br />The seat (when in the base) takes up quite a bit of space in my car (2013 Acura RDX).  It wouldn't fit behind the driver as the next fit now will.	0
I previously have had great luck with this brand , owned 2 prior to this one, BUT THIS ONE WAS GARBAGE...  It did not last 1 outing and poles twisted at top where holes punched for snap clips to lock in( same gauge material used on 10 x 10 canopies poles, it should be thicker on 12 x 12). I Will not purchase this brand until serious changes made in construction.	1
Who doesn't like a PS3?! I still think XBOX is better but i love my ps3 as I have been on the sony playstation addiction since their 1st system.	1
What can I say its a fancy piece of plastic used to help me measure in odd places.  Does what it intends to do but I wonder if I could have used a piece of cardboard to do the same.  Nice magnetic feature but honestly not impressive item no matter how you build it.  They should add a way to prop it up on the ground	0
kids just absolutely loved he gift basket. Great packaging and a great price for a kid friendly gift. would definitely consider ordering another one in the future.	1
I really like the color and this pillow is made of safe fabric. Very soft, smooth and comfortable that specially designed for babies.	1
The Daddy Daughter / Father Son Basketball workout DVD isn't just a workout a DVD it's a bonding experience, that I believe is great for all ages kids and teens. I have already started to use this DVD with my kids and little cousins. Growing up basketball kept me active during the summer, in shape, and out of trouble. This DVD allows kids to have fun and not feel like it's tough work to learn a great sport, and it also allows children to build some type of focus...	1
Just received my oCosomo 40 inch TV. Cost- $278.00. Easy set up. Great picture. Smashing sound. What a bargain. I am not a TV nerd, but this looks great to me. Incredible price. Love it. Buy it.	1
We have a black lab that is shedding an unreasonable amount of fur this summer. We have clumps everywhere, and I have to vacuum everywhere at least once per day to make the house look inhabitable. A personality quirk of mine: I don't want to. I loathe cleaning and resent that my dog is making me do it with such frequency.<br /><br />This broom flat out works. On the floor it works great, but the three places that it really helps me out are on the stairs, in the bathroom and on our furniture. The rubber bristles collect hair very effectively.<br /><br />I hate still cleaning, but I would definitely buy this broom again. It has made an untenable situation slightly more bearable.	0
This tool does not work for a Ford 4.6 pulley!  a 4.6 pulley is metric, the tool is SAE, and oh yea it stripped out my new pump and wasted a $100 pump.  DO not buy this it is cheap and will be a waste of your money.  FYI I am a 20 year mechanic with a Powerplant license.	0
this watch was my birthday present from my wife..so great.nice watch. this is a stunningly beautiful watch and no one will guess the price unless you tell them.	1
Its very convenient and simple to use. it also includes a laser pointer which I use quite often now. Overall it just makes presentations easier.	1
The only drawback is, they have a miss-matched look. The rose design doesn't look the same on each foot. But, as I haven't used them yet, I'm unsure as to whether they'll scare the fish away! And, I don't think they'll notice.	1
insufficient info on product, did not connect to my female speakon, looking at it harder, the center connection is round and not kinda cresent shaped to fit my speakon, maybe this was for a 4 connection vs 2 connect, but product didn’t say, so just out the money	0
This is a great case at an amazing deal! I couldn't find a cheaper yet higher quality case than this. I am very happy with the product!	1
Pillows were bought for me and my husband. Had to buy for grand-daughter and mother as well, so they would leave ours alone.	1
AMAZING! Yes I have tried other products but none have given me a truly hands free experience and wonderful perfect moments that end so intensively. The pulsating after wards is always perfect and never off key if you know what I mean. Truly enjoyable.	0
This case fits the Relay nicely but it is not &#34;rubberized&#34; as advertised.  It has a coating of what appears to be flat black paint.  It will not afford any more protection than the basic case itself.	0
I've only had this dual-drive for about 1 month, but no issues so far.  It seems very fast.  Using Acronis software, I backed up 44 GB in about 20 minutes.  I'm using it in a RAID 1 configuration, so 4TB mirrored.	0
This feeding bowl is ideal for when our granddaughter aged 18 months comes to stay. Stays put with the suction and no sliding around. Very quick delivery. Would recommend this to anyone.	1
This is pricy, works if you useas soon as you know, don't wait. However, in emergency situation we used acne wash and that was just as good to strip off poision Ivy oil. So, if you want to save, just buy Scalic acidance soap or something like that.	0
For the price I wish the shades were made a little better. The plastic on the silver part just doesn't work for me it makes the shades look cheap. I do love the size though.	1
Astronomy, sighting in at the range, this is a beautiful binocular which feels sturdy and should last me a long time. I have the 16x50 also. Both have their use.	0
For running, for fashion! This is a very nice creation! Perfect for everyday use! I love it Nike! I'm planning to buy another design soon!	1
Fit the nest easily with no modifications covered the existing hole in my wall and saved me time from needing to paint	1
I love this item, excellent value for the money, fits nicely and is just absolutely adorable for the young chef in my life	0
I had this kit for a couple years now, it is not a dremel by no means but the quality is ok and the price is amazing, so basically you get what you pay for and more, its got a little bit of everything so its very comprehensive and a great starter kit for a beginner, I highly recommend this to someone starting out.<br /><br />I only gave it 3 stars rating because its a little on the cheap side but for the money its well worth it, but if I was going to buy again I would the 500pc set I have linked here, I've seen it at a friends place and its comprehensive and a surprisingly good quality and looks kick@$$ [[ASIN:B00CVZSLR6 500pc Rotary Tool Accessories Set (kit) Bits Fits Dremel for Cutting Grinding Sanding Polishing]]	1
Very strong bags they tend not to rip as easier as other bags out there, I'm very happy with the texture of the bags and I think I can confidently carry these bags with my dog to the park and not have to worry about the bag going on me its not extremely thin plastic and that leaves me in the green.	1
Bought one of these a few weeks ago for my son.  I liked it so well, had to buy this one for myself (even though I've got a dozen of so name-brand lights around the house).  It has now found a permanent place in my range bag.  Powerful light, not a battery hog, a clip that works, a light that tail-stands.  What's not to like.	0
before i bought these, i had a hard time opening my hatch with large spoiler and now with these pair i can open it effortless. im very pleased with it...	0
Why didn't I buy one of these sooner?! It saves SO much time. I've run into a couple wires where it doesn't catch on the first try, it just strips it a little but. But, a little hand adjustment using the screw on the front fixes that. It even has a wire cutter on the upper part of the handle - we cut electrical wires with ease. This this is heavy duty - spend the extra money, and you'll be so glad you did.	1
I am already a huge fan of My Konjac Face Sponges, so I was very excited to try this Baby Sponge! It's super soft, ideal for my son's sensitive skin! And I love that it's 100% natural! Plus your baby gets fascinating by the fact that it gets super soft when it touches the water: fun bath time!	1
Outstanding picture quality from all reasonable view angles. Very lightweight. Excellent value. We use this for over-the air signals on our boat and it works great.	0
The old battery in my old Game Boy Advance just gave up the ghost. This was super easy to install, and it works just like the original. Thanks.	0
The thought of getting the toned figure that I was craving from a lotion was laughable for me at first, but now it turns out that such a thing was actually possible. My lovely figure is proof of that.	1
After trying kcups and never finding a good cup of coffee I purchased the Melitta thermal.  Finally a good cup of coffee!	0
Very sturdy and well made.  I have mounted 2 23&#34; monitors and it seems to be holding up fine.  I don't make adjustments very often so that isn't an issue with me.  The only problem I had, hence the 4 star rating, I had to run a tap through the mounting plate holes.  The mounting screw holes were filled with the powder coat or paint and the screws wouldn't go through.  Tapping them cleaned out the coating and then they worked as they should.	0
I purchased this for a friend of mine, who has a lot of hair, and it works perfectly for her, so spend a few extra buck and get what works, especially if you don't want your air getting wet while showering. It's really not that expensive and you get two! Come on folks buy it, keep dry!	0
i would not buy this set again. it may be lightweight and flimsy so it saves space in the closet. however, it breaks easily and it's  difficult to slip your clothes when hanging them. i don't like it at all.	1
I bought this for my daughter and she loves it. Perfect chain length and the pendant is just the right size.	1
I order this watch as a Christmas gift and it worked for about an hour and stopped running. I returned it and ordered a second one and after 7 hours it stopped working. This is a beautiful watch however it obviously has major issues!	0
My husband and I are quite different in height -- I am 5'4&#34; and he is 6'.  Neither one of us found the backpack very comfortable to wear.  It hits in a weird place and puts a lot of strain on your back.<br /><br />It's decently light, but add 20+ pounds of baby, and it gets heavy fast!  Also found it to be hot when we were hiking (July, so yes, it's hot, but &#34;hotter&#34;).<br /><br />We'll keep looking for a backpack that is more comfortable and fits at least one of us.  (Preferably him, so he can hike with the baby on his back!)	0
Best game ever made...you can literally do anything. If you have an xbox or play station you would be dumb not to get this	0
Arrived late, to my dismay, so I re-scheduled my appointment. Took it to the blue and yellow big box store along with the pioneer deck and was advised by the stereo manager it is not allowed (for legal reasons i don't want to elaborate on) to have installed in TN and I was asked to take it home with me by the blue and yellow big box store car stereo manager. They made sure I would not slip it to anyone in the bay... Waiting on seller for a month now to send me a call tag for the return and my refund.	1
it cuts down on the amount of litter the cats track around the house and it is very easy to clean.  the rubber is great quality, except that its too small	0
Got this as a wedding gift last week. Seemed cheapy but we were looking forward to using it more than many other things we got. Total bust. Broke on us on the 2nd vegetable. Threw it in the garbage. Needs to be made much better. People, please buy quality gifts or just give cash	1
I love this they are so easy to use!! I run a daycare out of my house. I was so worried about on of the little one hitting the edge of the coffee table, so I took them out of the living room. Now that I have these I get to have coffee tables back in my living room. Because the add esxtra protection and I'm not tarrifeied of them bumping the heads. I have this one and the white one love them both	1
My wife ordered one similar to this one for Christmas but was not available.  I found this to be as close to what she wanted.  She really liked it and said I picked the one she liked.	0
I love these, we all have to wear stockings at some point under a dress or what not but these are just secretly sexy underneath your dress, me and my boyfriend love it.	0
I'm glad I've owned two of these before buying it through Amazon, because the reviews on here are SCARY. People are talking about it falling on their animals, not dispensing water, leaking, etc. I even thought about not repurchasing, because of them, but then I thought to myself, &#34;that's crazy. Go with what YOU know.&#34; So I'm here to share my experience with this bottle.<br /><br />I have a five-year-old chinchilla living in a five-tiered wire cage with plastic tiers/bottom. I have the plastic, because he outgrew the curious stage and doesn't nibble/bite on anything (not power cords, not his cage, mainly just books when he's playing and of course his wooden chews inside his cage). Regardless, when I initially bought this, he WAS chewing on plastic, so I wanted something glass that could hang on his old cage, on the outside (I still hang this on the outside, because he does do a lot of jumping around, and I don't want him dislodging it).<br /><br />I don't use anything extra to secure the bottle. I use the coil only, and the bottom part rests in-between the wires. It's never once been knocked down. I had the smaller bottle at first, and it DID have issues dispensing water, but I always mark the water line with new bottles and check back within a few hours to see that it's significantly lower, so I knew right away of the issue. The person at Petsmart suggested the bigger bottle. It didn't have this issue. I could see the bubbles immediately when my chinchilla drank.<br /><br />After about a year, it started leaking. I think this is due to me fiddling too much with the pipe that dispenses the later (the part the animal drinks out of and the part that screws in are separate parts). I got a new one. And that's the one I've had ever since. I clean it with a pipe cleaner regularly and a mild soap/water solution, because the inside of the bottle can get a little gross, even if it's glass. That's precisely the reason I bought him a new bottle. The old one, after a fewyears, was just a little too gross.<br /><br />And this one works fine as well. So here are my suggestions after years of ownership:<br /><br />1. Buy the big bottle.<br />2. Still mark the water line with a sharpie or something to see that it goes down.<br />3. Clean the inside regularly.	0
The products included in this basket had no scent whatsoever. The box was taped together and falling apart. I was very disappointed in the extremely bad quality of this product.	1
Not only was I surprise at the low price, the fact that this product has functioned well from day 1 of installation has really surprised me. It is excellent.	1
purchased this for my dog and its so nice easy to fold and also its very portable,when my pet is in it seems so comfortable.	1
This is one really awesome dress , it is really nice! I bought it for my girlfriend because we were going to a business meeting together and she needed some stylish to look good. The size of this dress was perfect , it looked just perfect on her. With a pair of heels this dress is amazing!	1
It is easy to put on, I have no problem, bubblegum too strong. It's nice to know my phone has a protective layer does not really feel the difference on the screen. Tempered glass is very sleek and smooth. These types of purchase, the product will not last forever. Very good service. I received my screen saver. Simple instructions, it took everything I need.	1
I was a bit skeptical at first when I received the slicer. However I was surprised it worked this well. It was simply yet effective. I only used it for cucumbers, large carrots and zucchini. I will try it out on other veggies very soon and keep you updated. Thanks for letting me try this on out.	1
Hit the vibrate button and immediately get our dog's attention. He likes to bite our shoes but after we use the vibrate mode on him just one time and now he doesn't bother my shoes any more. Really helped us a lot. Thank you.	1
I bought this screen after seeing my sister had a similar screen. This is nothing like hers.  Her screen has magnets about 5 inches apart from one another from top to bottom. It always closes properly. With this screen, it's hit or miss on the closing. Most of the time you have to go back to the screen just to close it right.  I don't recommend this screen. It's poorly made.	0
I love this stroller! I bought the silver one and it looks great! Very easy to assemble! Very easy to remove the seat and attach the car seat. I wish the car seat adapter came with it.	1
Had a similar unit a few years ago that eventually disassembled itself through sheer use. This one ups the ante with the addition of a strobe mode and a wider headband although the tilt mechanism seems to be a bit more unwilling. This could turn out to be an asset. The old one could last for 40+ hours using a combination of spot and red light modes. It's ability to pivot proved immeasurable when I adorned my house with 10,000+ Christmas mini-lights. I hope to get the same performance from this unit.	0
The texture of my hair and my nails I have noticed the most in using this supplement. Amazing results.	1
I can understand the premise and I like the premise.<br />However, I just don't believe that these bibs are comfortable for baby.<br /><br />While they are not hard, they are not soft.<br /><br />The Oxo Tot Roll Up bib has a truly soft front with a catch for whatever doesn't make it into baby's mouth.  It also has a flat velcro closure as opposed to Babybjorn's plastic snap closure.<br /><br />Babybjorn can be cleaned off easier, while Oxo would need to be washed when truly soiled.<br />But...Oxo can be rolled up for travel.	0
I wish I would have purchased avery labels, but it works great,even with memorex labels. as expected, no problems what so ever.	0
This stevia product is the real deal, not like other products with a label that says 100% Stevia and then turns out to be "cut" with a non-nutrient... like the product I recently bought at Whole Foods. (Check the ingredients label, not just the front.)    Nature's Candy brand stevia also avoids the metallic tastes of other brands. I buy the 1 pound bag and decant into smaller shakers. Shakers work because it doesn't attract moisture, so doesn't have to be firmly capped.	1
If I don't wear it even for a single day, the watch stops running. It appeared like the automatic energy storage worked better when I first received it, but in just a few short months, the mechanism has deteriorated where I have to wear it or "shake" the watch everyday to prevent it from stopping. The watch itself is very nice to look at and I've received compliments from friends on the unusual color of the watch.	1
I was really excited about this filter because it looks nearly identical to the Renovo Trio but its a few buck cheaper. Its cheaper because they don't package it properly and because they are selling my contact information and they are using questionable marketing tactics.  First, the packaging; this filter has an activated carbon filter in it. Anyone that knows anything about filtration (air or water) knows that activated carbon MUST BE SEALED. The activated carbon is sensitive enough that it will absorb pollutants in the air and wear out. So, as the filter sits in their warehouse the activated carbon is being used up which means it will have questionable efficacy when you really need it. My filter showed up in a cheap box with a sticker on it. These should be sealed at the factory. I placed mine in a vacuum sealed bag when I got it so hopefully there is still some life left. Being curious as to what I might expect in terms of shelf life, I checked their website and was surprised to find very little technical documentation. It was mostly marketing hype. They apparently haven't done any lab testing to certify the filter in any way. So, I went to Renovo Trio's website to see if they had anything and they had overwhelming amounts of data. I found full testing documentation and some helpful information about the activated carbon filter. According to Renovo (who has done testing), the activated carbon filter is good for 1,000 liters OR 1 year out of its packaging (the Renovo is hermetically sealed). So, if this filter sat in some warehouse for 8 months or so before I received it, then I've got 3-4 months to use it before the activated carbon filter is useless. Don't get me wrong, as a two stage filter, this is pretty good but I paid for a three stage filter and that is what I was expecting.  Second, a week or so after ordering this, I get some telemarketer calling from Survivor Filter trying to get my email and other details so I can end up on some marketing list. I have NEVER had this happen on Amazon and I hope it doesn't become the norm.  So, if you are looking for something that will make you feel like you're prepared (when you really aren't) and you don't care to investigate the validity of a manufacturers claims, buy this! If you would prefer to buy from a company that tests their own products and stands behind their product without selling your name and contact details to a marketing company, then look elsewhere (Sawyer, Renovo, Berkey even Lifestraw).	1
I was talked into this purchase and I'm still yelling at the person for this choice. Had I not thrown out the boxes immediately, I would have returned it. Trying to screw the legs in properly to the seat is nearly impossible. I had to give up and settle for close enough. I will get the rounded seats I wanted originally soon. Very disappointed.	0
Best in the market.  Left my cold water in my car on accident during my 12-6 shift. When i got in my car,  it read 102°F. Real hot. I curiously opened my hydroflask and took a sip....still cold. Oh my goodness. Not lukewarm. COLD.	0
I wasn't sure if these were designed specifically for women. It has a fingertip design that protects fingernails. I had to get used to the plastic claws for holding other tools. I think they can be better if made with other materials.	1
I've had a lot of TVs in my day but this is by far the best. No issues with it all and a crystal clear picture. Looks good and is easy to use.	1
I bought this for my boyfriend. and he loves it. I don't know why he loves shoes that are big. he looks like Mc Donald while wearing this. but what can I do? he likes these kind of shoes. I won't even care about it as long as I know what will I buy for me.	1
Alright, this is a review that is based on my first week of experience. Everything is pre-installed, you don't have to do anything except connect to your screen and power supply. Of course, there are optional applications that came with a disc. Activation code is labeled on the computer. Everything works out fine. All the driver updates and applications that are necessary for your hard drive took about 10% of storage, something that I found some people do complain about. But nothing useless is found, unlike majority of pc on the market. Now as for gaming. It does allow you to run majority of games that are available. However, keep that in mind, lots of games have low requirements, so this hardware works just fine. I use mmohut as reference, but a lot game review sites have similar rating on games. For their top rate games, this computer is nothing to brag about. Many popular games have way too high requirement that is just out of this computer's league. It does allow me to play certain game like Soul of Ultimate Nation at high setting very smooth. For a casual gamer, less intensive applications, and for $500, this computer is truly a steal. But if you want to run heavy intensive games like WoW, Terra, and so on; you can settle for low setting or do some serious upgrades. My new parts are arriving soon, so I will update as soon as I can.<br /><br />Update: I bought AMD Radeon HD 7850 ($210) to replace the graphic card that came with the machine. Now this is truly a gaming computer. Everything is above 7.0 in Windows Index except hard drive. The new graphic card makes the machine runs extremely quiet, unlike before which felt a trunk driving by every single time it is turned on. Although I did upgrade the memory ram to 16GB, which I don't think it's really necessary for everyone. My advice to everyone that want to play some of the popular game today, upgrade to a better graphic card. Another thing I notice is that my computer's motherboard is GA-78LMT-S2, while current product description is ASRock 960GM-GS3 FX. They probably changed to the newer one.<br /><br />My rating still remains. I'm not a hardcore gamer, but I do want to run the games I like in medium to high settings smoothly. This is also my first time to purchase a built PC and have upgrade it myself. I'm ok with what it is, and can be upgraded quite easily.	1
I love playing computer games and I noticed my all mouse does not work well. With Dland Zelotes mouse I play much better. I am very happy with this buy. Will recommend to my friends-gamers.	1
Lights that I received are not bright and color was different. They look very different like on the picture. I was hoping for right color	1
This basket was a gift for my Italian father living in Arizona. I wanted to give him a little of home out in the desert.  He was quite pleased with the basket.	0
I've tried many organizers, some were so poorly made that I threw them out after a couple days. This one is very solidly made and I'd definitely recommend it.	1
Looks great! Didn't break and are beatiful! Recommend getting! P.s. Gold frame does not look lime ugly, yellow street paint.	0
I received this brand of suitcase as a gift which, initially, I was pleased with the size and appearance. Upon only 2 uses, the suitcase cracked across the back and they refuses to replace, repair or offer any assistance.	1
I might even consider using these inside when I need extra seats at the counter.<br /><br />Stack neatly and will be easy to store for winter.	0
I love these boots and wear them almost daily for working in the garden and in the yard. Turns out it's pretty hard to find women's work boots that aren't bedazzled or covered in designs, but these ones are great. They fit great, seem to be pretty waterproof, and are very comfortable.	0
Bought this as a replacement for an old Sony point and shoot that lasted forever until an unfortunate accident with the ocean.  (dont ask ;-)  This camera has lots of different settings and a good zoom with lots of modern features such as the antiblur among other things.  When I was comparing cameras, I also looked at the 2013 version of this camera the HX-30V and found them to be more or less the same, with the exception of maybe a little bit better version of zoom on the 30-V, however the 2013 version of this camera costs 70 to 100 dollars more than this one.  So if the 20 x zoom is worth the difference in price versus the 16x on this one, then go for the 30-v, but if not, then this is a good choice that takes good pictures and is reasonably priced.	0
I got the microphone, it synced with my Mac immediately. I was using Audacity to record and it worked beautifully.... for about a half hour! After that, I hadn't even unplugged it, two of the settings no longer registered noise. The computer still registered that the microphone was plugged in. The stereo/bidirectional setting would work perfectly, then as soon as I changed it to the cardioid or omni setting, my voice did not register.<br />After two days of conversations with the Service Department at Blue Microphones, they said it was a faulty device and that I would have to pay for shipping back in order to get it resolved.<br />**Note that the company does not cover any shipping costs for product maintenance under their warranty.**<br />Be aware of that when planning to buy this equipment. It is highly frustrating as I live in Australia and would have to ship the product back to their Service Department in the US.<br />I will not be working with Blue Microphones in the future. I will say, however, that I loved the microphone for the half hour that it worked.<br /><br />Good luck!	0
Nice taste.  I use it in my coffee, smoothies, make ice cream or other frozen treats, baking and cooking. Good milk replacement.	0
It works best with regular paper and I can do about 2 sheets at a time on card stock.  It's light weight and easy to store.<br />It met my expectations for the price.	0
I live in an area with poor coverage and this only worked for a week. 3 stars for I am able to donate a dollar or more to whoever horrible person that came up with this. I'm changing networks anyway.	1
Nice tablet, bought it about a week ago and I've been using it for a few days now. The design looks cool and I haven't gotten any issues with it yet. The tablet is working smooth and is easy to hold in your hands. Me, my kids and my wife love this tablet!	1
i came to amazon looking for a different scanner but chose this one based on customer reviews. i thought it to be a little pricey at first, but i figured if i don't like it, i'll return it. well, this scanner rocks. it does everything i wanted it to do. it's super fast and configurable. it's very user friendly. you can tell when they designed it they tested it out well before it came to market. i have scanned just about everything i can think of with awesome results.	0
This liner would be great if it wasn't too wide and too short. I have to hang my curtain rod lower than I would, so that this liner fits properly	1
I hate this product. This was a waste of my money. The dimensions weren't what they say there are online. Come on, people.	1
Beautiful watch but the coating/coloring on the band has started to rub off after only about a month here.	0
This watch has a big face, hands and is well backlit with the whole dial lighting up so for people over forty whose eye sight is changing you can still see the time.	0
Again...not for Scrapbookers. Has a rough surface, not flat and smooth, not good for stamping at all. Not good for more storage options underneath, limited in height to the left or right because of the slanting bars underneath. But it is a very nice table otherwise. Easy to fold out or put away.	0
cleans very well and leaves a nice fresh scent of citrus in the kitchen, bathroom and on the floors. Also just started using it to clean around the patio area and I think it does keep the bugs at bay, hard to get away from bugs in florida but I noticed when I clean the outside area bugs are scarce. I will be getting another bottle	0
I was the hero at my son's birthday party. I gave this to my son at his party and he opened them right away, all the kids were working out and all the adults were eating cake, it was a classic scene.	1
I guess for.the price, they werent bad. They came flat and most of the puff leaked into the package. I got about 3 good puffs out of all cigarettes, so may spend a little more next time	0
I travel for work and have small children at home - both are good reasons to have a rugged case for my new Surface Pro 3. The Urban Armor Gear case does not disappoint. Not too bulky, well-built, and light. The kickstand could be a little easier to pull out, but that's a minor criticism. Overall, I am pleased with the purchase.	1
This is an excellent bike pump with gauge! I have tried it on both my mountain, and road bikes. The bike pump is a nice size, but you don't sacrifice efficiency because it shifts air into the tire when you push the handle in and out. I have used it to completely re-inflate one of the 29&#34; tires on my mountain bike. It didn't take any time at all and I wasn't burned up at the end of it. The pump itself is a sturdy, well thought out, and constructed design. The mounting bracket works very well, even if you have bottle cages. I'd highly recommend this pump if you do any kind of cycling.	1
I started eating Manuka honey a couple of years ago when I was on a trip over to New Zealand. There were a lot of cool little honey shops spread throughout the country so I ended up tasting a lot of different regional honeys. Happy Valley was one of the honey shops that we stopped into. Most of the honeys we tried down there tasted pretty amazing and were full of health benefits.  We bought some of this and the Wildflower blend recently and they are just like the honeys I had when I was traveling over there.  It is really cool to see that I can get this without having to go all the way down to New Zealand. This is  beautiful mild honey and I put it anything, so not overpowering - a real clean taste.	1
I only wish I had found this sooner for my Dad, who has some dementia and short term memory loss.  He loves it.<br /><br />First: It's well-packaged and arrived in perfect condition.  Big numbers/letters, & easy to read, even from a distance in a bright or dark room.  Easy to set up (it comes pre-set to EST).<br /><br />That said, since it includes the day & date, it should also be able to determine if daylight savings time is in effect - especially for its whopping price!  I also took back a star for not putting any information on the rear button controls.  You will have to keep the written instructions to easily know how to reset the clock.<br /><br />But overall, very pleased with this purchase.	0
The works well and looks good. Its inexpensive too.<br /><br />*NOTE*: You will need to have a UTG Receiver Cover in order to mount this properly.	0
Perfect product to add taste to water without unwanted artificial flavors.<br />Great for summer months ahead to keep hydrated.	1
Unlike other dress shoe laces, they don't come untied. I thought they were a bit too pricey, but having your shoes come untied is no bargain, either.	1
Can buy locally for cheaper.  Doesnt really pick much up.  Used a few times, but will not keep using, just does not do the job.	1
I'm an idiot, a moron, am hopeless. When it comes to picking out &#34;GIRLIE STUFF&#34;... Just ask my loving bride of over 35 years.  So when I saw this and I loved it, I KNEW it must be just awful. I had to try. She has spent 6 straight months nursing me after a LOT of &#34;stuff&#34; from surgical complications etc. She gave up 3 weeks of her vacation and a lot more to care for me tirelessly. I saw this and HAD to at least try. It was so affordable I knew it was something I could afford to lose money on if another failure.<br /><br />  To my amazement she LOVES this, and her love for it is genuine. When an old dingbat ..... oh wait....when my beloved little bride gets that &#34;look&#34; on her face, you know, the kind when she is going to cry and you PANIC but then pause since you soon realize it is going to be &#34;happy tears&#34;? Well that is what I got. I was tempted to tell her I loved her so much that all these precious diamonds were NOTHING compared to my love of her. But I figured I would get just about half of that out of my mouth before a plate would be flying across the room with my name on it:-)<br /><br />  So in reality, while I wish with all my heart that I COULD give her real diamonds and precious stones. I Wish I could give her everything in this world AND the next, whatever that may be. But I CAN give here this and tell her I love her and hope to be a better and more well hubby and that will have to do for now. In the meantime this earns a full 5 stars. It looks AMAZING for the cost and is an honestly very nice product that made my wife show me those big &#34;little girl&#34; eyes again for the first time in a long time. What a bargain!	0
Should have done some research before buying this model. WiFi I told myself, great! Color touch screen to access all the features, great! I guess it was just a bad model or something, prints well for documents, NOT pictures, oh and the ink? $80 for all 4 cartridges, and if you print a lot in color, you will go through them like water. Oh and the best part. it seems, though connected via WiFi, that 75% of the time, its “offline" and needs to be rebooted. 2 stars and save your money.	1
Classic game that is never boring for any age. It is great when visiting folks who remember this game from when they were teenagers and played it at home with their parents..way before video games and computers isolated family members into their separate rooms of the house!	0
I just love the color and the design of this watch .My aunt gave me this one as a gift which made my sister a little jealous by the way ... The look is expensive and it's feels good on me.I love the leather, it is very comfortable on the wrist.The watch can be weared with any color .I would recommend this one :)	1
I only wear small studs with screw on backs and these fit the bill.<br /><br />Nice color and great quality.	0
These Monster In-Ear Headphones are my first Monster product that is not a cable. Monster has taken the headphone market by storm and grabbed a huge market share. Why? Is it because they are really good or is it because they are experts on marketing their products? Don't know but it's probably both.<br /><br /> These bright cobalt blue ear-buds have a very good sound. The treble is sweet and high without being tinny. The base is surprisingly good for ear-buds and it doesn't sound muddy. The mids fill in the middle well. The overall sound is crisp without being harsh, smooth without being muddy.<br /><br />The cable is 50 inches long.<br /><br />The packaging looks great if you are giving them as a gift.<br /><br />Lightweight so not to pull out of the ear easily.<br /><br />Three sizes of lite rubber ear cups are provided so they should fit just about anyone.<br /><br />Comes with a small velcro tie for keeping the cable wrapped up and a lapel clip.<br /><br />The ear-buds are magnetized on the back so you can stick the two ends together.<br /><br />For the price it would have been nice to have a case included.<br /><br />Well constructed with a solid feel.<br /><br />The jack turns at a 45 degree angle.<br /><br />Can be used for cell phone use with built-in mic. (I do not use this controller)<br /><br />The cable is flat instead of the usual round which seems to not tangle as easily.<br /><br />Overall these are a great sounding pair of ear-buds. Although pricier then many products out there they are way cheaper then high-esr in-the-ear phones. I think you'll be pleased with them.<br /><br />NOTE: IF YOU WANT THE BEST SOUND OUT OF ANY EAR-BUDS, IF YOU ARE USING A SMART PHONE OR TABLET, DOWNLOAD A GOOD EQUALIZER APP. THERE ARE MANY ON THE MARKET AND MOST OF THEM WILL BRING YOUR MUSIC TO A NEW LEVEL.	0
Very solid book to pick up deep enough information to start using LINQ, written in a very nice way not hard or boring to read. Will be good for beginner for sure may work for somebody who wants to get better understanding of what's going on under the hood of LINQ.	0
Loving the grill mat am very happy camper because it keep my veggie in one place without falling through my griller. Also, love that it keep my meat juicer	1

My midwife calls this book the worst case scenario book for all things pregnancy and generally makes you feel terrified at every week... I found this to be extremely true. I am a couple months in and already I've been scared of like 10 things. Really I think that you should listen to your body and talk to your doctor / midwife and let them do the diagnosis. This book is helpful but I think that it kind of takes away from the joy of the pregnancy process	1
